The Associated Press and multiple outlets said the race was simply too close to call, though the Clinton camp claimed a narrow victory.&#xA;Both candidates will now move on to New Hampshire buoyed up, Clinton with a &#x201c;sigh of relief&#x201d; that her bid to be the first female president of the United States is alive, and Sanders believing that his revolution against the &#x201c;billionaire classes&#x201d; truly began in the snowy cornfields of Iowa.&#xA;With half of the results in across the rural midwest state, Clinton appeared to be easing to victory, three points up on the Vermont senator, whose relatively ramshackle campaign seemed to be no match for her mighty political machine.&#xA;But as the night wore on, Clinton&#x2019;s lead shrank to two and then one point, until she was locked in a virtual tie with the 74-year-old whose passion has ignited a fervour among young Americans.&#xA;Appearing onstage in Des Moines before the final tally arrived, Clinton hailed &#x201c;a contest of ideas&#x201d; and appeared battle-ready for the fight of her political life.&#xA;She congratulated her opponent, saying: &#x201c;I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us in America.&#x201d;&#xA;Upsets, ties and dropouts: the Iowa caucuses in two minutes - video report&#xA;The democratic socialist, though, has stolen some momentum heading into the New Hampshire primary on 9 February &#x2013; and a prolonged fight appears inevitable, a far cry from what had been envisaged as a graceful procession toward the nomination for Clinton.&#xA;By almost 11pm local time, the two Democratic rivals had both given what sounded like competing victory speeches.&#xA;Sanders raised the roof as he told supporters: &#x201c;While the results are still not known, it looks like we are in virtual tie,&#x201d; adding: &#x201c;The people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, the economic establishment, and by the way to the media establishment.&#x201d;&#xA;Largely written off by both the media and Democratic leaders, Sanders has been attracting huge crowds across the state since he first started campaigning here in the summer and made Clinton&#x2019;s poll leads that reached as high as 32% all but evaporate.&#xA;Late on Monday night in Des Moines, a crowd at Sanders&#x2019; victory party was watching him inch to within 0.2 percentage points down, to a tie on the television overhead, then back down to 0.2 points. Someone put on Sanders&#x2019; fight song &#x2013; the Simon &amp; Garfunkel anthem America. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve all come to look for America,&#x201d; sang the throng.&#xA;Speaking to reporters on a chartered plane flying to New Hampshire, Sanders called on officials to take the unusual step of revealing underlying voter totals.&#xA;Delegates are awarded in the Iowa Democratic contest on a precint-by-precinct basis , irrespective of the state-wide vote for each candidate.&#xA;&#x201c;I honestly don&#x2019;t know what happened. I know there are some precincts that have still not reported. I can only hope and expect that the count will be honest,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;&#x201c;I have no idea, did we win the popular vote? I don&#x2019;t know, but as much information as possible should be made available.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Iowa proved Bernie Sanders can win &#x2013; and that Hillary Clinton is beatable | Lucia Graves&#xA;At the Clinton event, the former first lady, secretary of state and senator was introduced by retired Iowa senator Tom Harkin and his wife Ruth, both popular figures who endorsed Clinton last summer.&#xA;Harkin embraced what he said was a &#x201c;narrow&#x201d; victory for Clinton, even as the results were still being counted. &#x201c;Hey, folks, a win is a win!&#x201d; he exclaimed. Later on, Clinton&#x2019;s campaign director in Iowa, Matt Paul, said there was &#x201c;no uncertainty&#x201d; that Clinton had won.&#xA;Clinton herself stopped short of declaring victory as she took the stage, flanked by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, before a crowd of roughly 700 supporters.&#xA;&#x201c;Wow, what a night, an unbelievable night,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Now, as I stand here tonight breathing a sigh of relief &#x2013; thank you.&#x201d;&#xA;At times the cheers so deafening they drowned out Clinton&#x2019;s words. It was an outright celebration, however narrow the result, of a candidate who eight years ago suffered a bruising defeat in the same state at the hands of Barack Obama.&#xA;This time, she will head to New Hampshire having hit her stride &#x2013; campaigning laboriously for every vote.&#xA;Last time she slipped to third in Iowa behind Obama and John Edwards. As midnight approached, with 50 of the 1,683 precincts still to declare, Clinton led 49.9% to 49.6%. However, rumours began to circulate that some of the results were in dispute and that the Democratic party had failed to staff 90 caucuses, raising the prospect of an ugly clash between the Clinton and Sanders camps.&#xA;"/>

Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Images&#xA;Tuesday 2 February 2016 02.04 GMT&#xA;Last modified on Tuesday 2 February 2016 12.46 GMT&#xA;Share on WhatsApp&#xA;Malaysia has accused Switzerland of breaking protocol and circulating misinformation when its attorney general said last week that billions of dollars had been stolen from Malaysian state-owned companies.&#xA;In the most scathing response by a member of the government to date, Malaysia&#x2019;s Minister of Communications Salleh Said Keruak told the Guardian that &#x201c;these premature statements appear to have been made without a full and comprehensive appreciation of all the facts.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Decision to clear Malaysian prime minister 'impossible' to overturn&#xA;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very unusual, and against normal protocol, for a senior official of one country to speak publicly on the internal matters of another country. Yet that is what the Swiss Attorney General has done,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;The rebuke adds fire to a burgeoning diplomatic standoff between Malaysia and Switzerland, one of several countries investigating corruption at 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad), a heavily-indebted state fund whose advisory board is headed by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.&#xA;Najib was himself cleared of corruption in Malaysia a week ago by the country&#x2019;s attorney general, who said the Saudi royal family was the source of a $681m &#x201c;donation&#x201d; to Najib&#x2019;s personal accounts just before the 2013 election.&#xA;The premier&#x2019;s critics allege the transfers was in fact linked to the 1MDB, an accusation that 1MDB, the attorney general and the prime minister deny.&#xA;A statement from the Swiss attorney general&#x2019;s office released late on Friday reignited graft allegations when it called for assistance from Malaysian authorities in a probe into the embezzlement of $4bn from 1MDB. It said investigators had &#x201c;revealed serious indications that funds have been misappropriated&#x201d;.&#xA;While the Swiss attorney general&#x2019;s office told the Guardian that Najib was not under accusation, the announcement focused intense international pressure on the government just three days after Najib said accusations against him had &#x201c;been comprehensively put to rest&#x201d;.&#xA;Cabinet minister Salleh told the Guardian that Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber should have first contacted his counterpart in Malaysia.&#xA;&#x201c;Does the Swiss AG normally talk to the media first, and then the relevant authorities afterwards?&#x201d; he said. Salleh said 1MDB had undergone extensive audits since 2009 and the $4bn figure &#x201c;simply could not have been misappropriated under such conditions.&#x201d;&#xA;He accused Lauber of inferring that the Malaysian attorney general had been uncooperative &#x201c;when in fact Malaysian authorities have been waiting to hear from their Swiss counterparts for many months,&#x201d; he said, referring to case evidence Malaysia has requested from Switzerland.&#xA;Malaysia&#x2019;s attorney general agreed over the weekend to cooperate with his Swiss counterpart.&#xA;Swiss investigators say a small portion of the stolen money was &#x201c;transferred to accounts held in Switzerland by various former Malaysian public officials and both former and current public officials from the United Arabic Emirates,&#x201d; without naming them.&#xA;The Swiss case was opened last August against two unnamed former 1MDB officials. Charges include bribery of foreign public officials, misconduct in public office, and money laundering.&#xA;Salleh also accused Lauber of spreading misinformation for saying Malaysian companies being investigated have made no comment on the losses they are believed to have incurred.&#xA;&#x201c;As anyone following developments related to 1MDB is well aware, the company has issued statement after statement &#x2013; providing detailed explanations, and a breakdown of its financials - to address questions that have previously been raised about these alleged losses.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;In certain Western media outlets, there exists a bias that it&#x2019;s the institutions and governments of developing &#x200e;countries that don&#x2019;t play it straight, while Western governments do. In this case, the actions of the Swiss Attorney General prove the opposite,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;Asked to respond to Salleh&#x2019;s comments, spokesman for the Swiss attorney general André Marty said: &#x201c;As a law enforcement body and judicial authority, the (Office of the Swiss Attorney General) has not to comment on political statements.&#x201d;&#xA;Marty said his office &#x201c;took note with satisfaction of the reaction of its Malaysian counterpart and of its commitment to fully support Switzerland&#x2019;s request for mutual assistance.&#x201d;&#xA;Investigations into 1MDB have been opened in Switzerland, Singapore, and Hong Kong.&#xA;A joint statement by the Commercial Affairs Department and the Monetary Authority of Singapore late on Monday said the bodies were still &#x201c;actively investigating possible money-laundering and other offences carried out in Singapore.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;In connection with these investigations, we have sought and are continuing to seek information from several financial institutions, are interviewing various individuals, and have seized a large number of bank accounts,&#x201d; it said.&#xA;The Hong Kong police told the Guardian on Tuesday that its investigation was ongoing, without providing further details.&#xA;The statement from Switzerland has drawn support from Najib&#x2019;s foes, including opposition members, for keeping the now-global investigation open.&#xA;&#x201c;It is crystal clear that (Malaysia attorney general Mohamed) Apandi has yet to verify the exact source of funds for the so-called &#x201c;donation&#x201d;,&#x201d; Malaysian opposition parliamentarian Tony Pua said.&#xA;&#x201c;Therefore, he cannot conclusively dismiss the possibility that part of the US$4 billion of misappropriated funds by 1MDB did not find its way to (Najib&#x2019;s) accounts.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian&#xA;&#x201c;So you are seeing attacks on lawyers who are considered outside of what the party would like them to do, and the same with labour activists,&#x201d; Crothall added. &#x201c;I doubt very much that is going to work but I suspect that is the rationale at the heart of all this.&#x201d;&#xA;Eli Friedman, a Cornell University labour expert, said the crackdown appeared designed to warn workers that unrest would not be tolerated at a time when many factories were either closing as a result of China&#x2019;s slowing economy or relocating to parts of south and south-east Asia where costs were lower.&#xA;China Labour Bulletin detected a &#x201c;massive upsurge&#x201d; in worker unrest in 2015, recording 2,774 such incidents, twice the previous year&#x2019;s figure.&#xA;&#x201c;Part of what is going on here is they are trying to figure out a way to send this message to workers that strikes are going to be treated increasingly as criminal events, which has not really been the case that much over the past 15 years,&#x201d; Friedman said.&#xA;&#x201c;Going to arrest some anonymous worker who has been involved in a strike and putting them in jail doesn&#x2019;t generate the same kind of media sensation [as arresting prominent labour activist leaders].&#x201d;&#xA;He Xiaobo&#x2019;s activism began in 2006, when then then migrant worker came to Foshan, a manufacturing hub in the southern province of Guangdong, from Henan province only to lose three fingers in an industrial accident.&#xA;Activists say millions of impoverished workers have been maimed since China&#x2019;s low-cost manufacturing boom began in the 1980s in a region that became known as the &#x201c;world&#x2019;s factory&#x201d;.&#xA;Incensed at the poor treatment of such migrants, He set up the Nanfeiyan Social Work Service Centre, a group that is credited with helping hundreds of wounded workers secure compensation from their employers after becoming injured or ill on the job.&#xA;Apo Leong, a retired campaigner who has known He for about a decade, said his &#x201c;comrade&#x201d; and friend believed it was his mission to help Guangdong&#x2019;s out-of-luck workers.&#xA;&#x201c;He always wants to see justice for the migrant workers &#x2013; particularly the accident victims &#x2013; because he himself was one of them,&#x201d; the Hong Kong-based activist said.&#xA;As part of that mission, He&#x2019;s group set up a hotline for injured workers seeking advice or assistance. He also made regular visits to hospitals in search of workers who had been cut loose by their employers having lost digits, limbs or been diagnosed with illnesses linked to their work in unsafe factories such as benzene poisoning or asbestos-related lung disease. &#x201c;He was very dedicated. He really cared for the workers,&#x201d; Leong added.&#xA;In a 2012 interview with Chinese state media , He complained of the government&#x2019;s mistreatment of migrants. &#x201c;Whenever the government launches a crackdown on disorder or littering, it mainly targets migrant workers,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;The detentions of He and his fellow activists have sparked outrage among campaigners , who have condemned Beijing&#x2019;s &#x201c;coordinated attack&#x201d; on the labour movement.&#xA;Writing in the Washington Post last month , three leading North American academics accused the Communist party of attempting to stamp out labour activism in Chinese civil society &#x201c;once and for all&#x201d;.&#xA;This week, Zhu Xiaomei, an activist who was also among those seized in early December, was released on bail.&#xA;He, who had repeatedly confided in his wife that he was facing increasing pressure from authorities and feared arrest, has had no such luck. &#x201c;I always told him: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t let it happen,&#x201d; Yang, 29, said. &#x201c;I was scared inside. I was worried.&#x201d;&#xA;Yang, who now cares for the couple&#x2019;s 21-month-old daughter, Shuangshuang, alone, flinches when asked whether she believes her husband&#x2019;s detention is part of a wider political campaign against those who speak out against the Communist party.&#xA;&#x201c;That is something that is over my head,&#x201d; she said cautiously, adding: &#x201c;No matter what charges they lay against him, I trust him. He is innocent.&#x201d;&#xA;As Yang remembers her absent husband and how she tried to convince him to step back from his frontline activism, her eyes become bleary. &#x201c;He once told me: &#x2018;If someone is going to have to make a sacrifice, I am willing to be the one.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

Other competitors, who had not been informed about the stunt and thought they had won, were left to digest the change in their fortunes.&#xA;One publisher described it as a humiliation. &#x201c;We believed it was a real announcement about the prizes. When they announced that Saga had won the prize for the best series, we jumped for joy,&#x201d; Pol Scorttecia, head of Urban Comics, told Charente Libre. &#x201c;We immediately tweeted the good news to the authors, Vaughan and Staples.&#x201d; Shortly afterwards, they learned it was a joke. &#x201c;They have not taken it very well. It&#x2019;s really annoying, even humiliating, for them. It borders on schoolboy humour when we&#x2019;re at an international festival.&#x201d;&#xA;Comic Book Resources reported that one editor left the room in tears when she realised what had happened. &#x201c;Nobody was pre-warned,&#x201d; Sam Souibgui, a joke winner and editorial director of Komikku, told Libération . &#x201c;It is an infamous cruelty. [Publisher] Cornelius shouted with joy when they won their fake prize. We were all happy, we had tears in our eyes, and we were humiliated. Thank goodness my authors weren&#x2019;t there, and I didn&#x2019;t have to explain this shitty French humour to them.&#x201d;&#xA;In response to the criticisms, the festival said that a characteristic of hoaxes was to &#x201c;briefly instil doubt to raise a smile&#x201d;, and that Gaitet had been asked to bring &#x201c;freedom, impertinence and humour&#x201d; to his role, &#x201c;in keeping with the spirit of independence of most comics creators&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;We can regret that the humorous register of this sequence was not shared or appreciated by everyone, and the festival organisers are ready to send their regrets by letter to those comic writers who may have felt offended by this sequence,&#x201d; they wrote in a statement. Franck Bondoux, the festival&#x2019;s executive director, told Sud Ouest that all major awards ceremonies are &#x201c;self-mocking&#x201d; and &#x201c;the problem is the dictatorship of the tweet&#x201d;.&#xA;But Gaitet himself apologised for the controversy, telling Le Monde in a statement that his &#x201c;fundamental mistake was to not have grasped the magnitude of expectations and hopes, the extreme emotions which filled the room on an occasion like this &#x2026; I&#x2019;m sincerely sorry to have hurt many professionals who work very hard to sustain this important art that I love: comics,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;No, it was not the place or the moment or the year to try a thing like this.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Comic-book festival bows to pressure over all-male award shortlist&#xA;In January, the Angoulême event had been heavily criticised after its 30-strong shortlist failed to include a single woman, prompting a number of artists who had been nominated to withdraw in protest. In response, the festival agreed to include some female names in its line-up. Bondoux told Le Monde at the time: &#x201c;The concept of the grand prix is to reward an author for their whole oeuvre. When you look at the prize list, you can see the artists on it have a certain maturity and a certain age. Unfortunately, there are few women in the history of comics art. It&#x2019;s a reality. If you go to the Louvre, you&#x2019;ll equally find very few women artists.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

It will also put resources behind a massive effort to prevent pregnant women becoming infected and, through mosquito control, stop the virus spreading.&#xA;Chan called the birth of thousands of babies with microcephaly &#x201c;an extraordinary event and a public health threat to other parts of the world&#x201d;. She was speaking following a meeting of the WHO&#x2019;s international health regulations emergency committee, summoned to advise the director general on whether to make the declaration, which calls in international resources and expertise.&#xA;WHO chief declares Zika virus as a public health emergency&#xA;&#x201c;Members of the committee agreed that the situation meets the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted this advice,&#x201d; she said.&#xA;Chan, who was criticised for being slow to make a similar declaration while Ebola spread across west Africa, sidestepped the question when asked if she felt that was a factor in the response to the Zika crisis in Brazil .&#xA;&#x201c;It is important to realise that when the evidence first becomes available of such a serious condition like microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities, we need to take action, including precautionary measures,&#x201d; she said.&#xA;Zika virus: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know when my daughter will walk or speak &#x2013; I see other mothers crying in desperation&#x2019; &#x2013; video&#xA;Tropical disease experts involved in the Ebola epidemic applauded the declaration. &#x201c;The WHO faced heavy criticism for waiting too long to declare the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency and they should be congratulated for being far more proactive this time,&#x201d; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s declaration will give the WHO the authority and resources it needs to lead the international response to Zika.&#x201d;&#xA;Chan called for countries to refrain from imposing any sort of travel restrictions on those Latin American countries where the Zika virus is spreading.&#xA;Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said: &#x201c;A kneejerk response would be to ban travel and trade with countries affected, but the truth is that the potential problem is much wider. It wouldn&#x2019;t really be feasible to lock down the affected countries to try to stop the spread of a virus that is carried by the Aedes mosquito, especially when affected and unaffected countries border one another.&#xA;&#x201c;Until populations can build up sufficient immunity, either through natural infection or through vaccination, then the risk to pregnant women is real and therefore this group need to take extra care to avoid becoming exposed.&#x201d;&#xA;Prof David Heymann, chair of the emergency committee, stressed that the most serious issue was not the Zika virus itself, which causes a mild illness, but the microcephaly cases in babies. &#x201c;Zika alone would never be a public health emergency of international concern,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is not a clinically serious infection.&#x201d; For that reason, he said, it was a very difficult decision.&#xA;The microcephaly clusters so far have appeared in Brazil and &#x2013; in 2014 before anybody realised the significance &#x2013; Polynesia. That, said Heymann, showed &#x201c;it appears to be spreading&#x201d;.&#xA;Zika spread map&#xA;Brazil has dispatched hundreds of thousands of troops on mosquito-eradication campaigns in the the worst affected areas, but the government is struggling to comprehend let alone cope with the epidemic.&#xA;While reported cases have spiked since the virus was first identified in the country last year, officials admit their estimate of 1.5m cases is based on guesswork.&#xA;Related: Zika virus could be bigger global health threat than Ebola, say health experts&#xA;&#x201c;Eighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms,&#x201d; the health minister Marcelo Castro told Reuters. &#x201c;A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious that we can imagine.&#x201d;&#xA;In an effort to get a clearer picture, the authorities have instructed local health authorities to report on all cases from next week, when most states should have the equipment and personnel to carry out Zica tests. It will ban people who have the virus from donating blood.&#xA;Despite the lack of reliable data, Castro said researchers were convinced that the virus was the cause of a spike in reported cases of microcephaly. A link has not been proven, but concerns are growing because the disease and the abnormality have both risen sharply.&#xA;Brazil&#x2019;s president, Dilma Rousseff, acknowledged at the weekend that the country was losing the battle. &#x201c;We do not have a vaccine for Zika yet. The only thing we can do is fight the mosquito,&#x201d; she told reporters during a visit to the emergency headquarters of the anti-Zika campaign. &#x201c;As long as [the mosquitoes] are reproducing, we are all losing the battle. We have to mobilise to win it&#x201d;.&#xA;Public health officials, backed by 220,000 troops, have stepped up efforts to kill breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquito, particularly in the poverty stricken northeast, where most cases have been concentrated.&#xA;On Monday, Rousseff signed a law allowing health officials access to any building to eradicate breeding grounds.&#xA;The new law allows health officials access to all homes, and public and private buildings, even if the property&#x2019;s owner cannot be located. Officials can request backup from police to raid any building suspected of being a mosquito breeding ground.&#xA;An estimated 1.5 million Brazilians have caught Zika, a virus first detected in Africa in the 1940s and unknown in the Americas until it appeared in May. The Pan-American Health Organisation said the virus had since spread to 24 countries and territories in the hemisphere.&#xA;By next month, the labs will have a test that can detect all three viruses borne by the Aedes mosquito &#x2013; dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. The test, however, will only be effective during the initial infection period of five days.&#xA;Related: How can the world fight Zika &#x2013; silent menace that threatens the unborn?&#xA;One of the main drivers of the WHO&#x2019;s declaration of an emergency is to fund and launch studies to find out where there is a definitive association with the Zika virus. Chan said: The evidence is growing and it is getting stronger. We need a coordinated international response to get to the bottom of this.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;It is a very complicated issue,&#x201d; said Heymann. &#x201c;To figure out the link with Zika virus, large numbers of cases of microcephaly have to be traced and assessed and the exposure of the mother to Zika virus has to be established. But the USA is working with Brazil and studies will start in the next two weeks.&#x201d;&#xA;Chen said surveillance needed to be strengthened. Scientists involved in the studies will need reliable reports of every case of microcephaly, which may not automatically be reported to doctors, especially in remote and poorer areas of Latin America. The WHO declaration will also encourage research and development of a vaccine against the virus and reliable diagnostic tests.&#xA;However, the Brazilian president&#x2019;s chief of staff said on Monday it would take researchers between three and five years to develop a vaccine against the virus.&#xA;Jacques Wagner told reporters that Brazilian researchers are working with researchers in the United States.&#xA;In his words, &#x201c;If we are really lucky, it could be three years. But it could be between three and five years.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

If unsuccessful, any future decisions to lift the ban will rest with politicians, who are largely conservative and opposed to change.&#xA;The supreme court made a surprise ruling in 2013 that reinstated the ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalisation.&#xA;After the hearing, gay rights activists outside the court sang: &#x201c;We will be successful.&#x201d;&#xA;The human rights group Amnesty International India welcomed the court&#x2019;s review, saying the law puts gay people under physical, mental and legal threat. &#x201c;The supreme court has another chance to correct a grave error.&#x201d;&#xA;Polls show about three-quarters of Indians disapprove of gay sex and are deeply traditional about other issues of sexuality, such as sex outside of marriage.&#xA;India is one of 75 countries where gay sex is illegal, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.&#xA;Although the law banning gay sex is rarely enforced in India, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.&#xA;There are no official figures on the number of cases of harassment, and most go unreported as victims are too scared to report crimes to the police, fearing they will be punished too, activists say.&#xA;While the previous Congress-led government had pledged to repeal the law if it came to power again, it was crushed by Narendra Modi&#x2019;s Bharatiya Janata party in general elections in May 2014.&#xA;In December, members of the BJP, which has an overwhelming majority in the lower house of parliament, scuppered a private member&#x2019;s bill to scrap the law.&#xA;&#x201c;It is about principles of freedom enshrined in our constitution,&#x201d; said Shashi Tharoor, the opposition Congress politician who introduced the bill.&#xA;"/>

Nothing would be more harmful to the idea of the West and world peace than if he were to be elected president. George W. Bush's America would seem like a place of logic and reason in comparison.&#xA;Donald Trump recently spoke about American football. No other game more fully embodies his country's character. The sport is about capturing territory, and players need to be tough and fearless to win. A player who is afraid of being tackled by someone from the opposing team while running has already lost the game. &quot;I don't even watch it as much anymore,&quot; Trump told a crowd of his supporters in Reno, Nevada. &quot;The whole game is all screwed up.&quot;&#xA;A growing number of studies point to the devastating consequences of the many tackles in the game, in which players try to stop their opponents by throwing themselves at them head-first: brain trauma, depression, suicide. New rules have been created, and there are now stiffer penalties for the most glaring fouls.&#xA;On the stage in Reno, Trump said he missed &quot;what used to be considered a great tackle, a violent head-on tackle.&quot; He slammed his fists together and repeated himself, vulgarly pursing his lips as he said the word &quot;violent.&quot; &quot;You used to see these tackles and it was incredible to watch, right?&quot;&#xA;And today? &quot;Bing! Flag!&quot; Trump shouted. &quot;The referees, they want to all throw flags so their wives see them at home.&quot;&#xA;&quot;Football has become soft,&quot; he said, repeating the sentence as if it were a key hypothesis on the state of the nation. &quot;Football has become soft like our country has become soft!&quot; As he held up his index finger, the crowd cheered and people held signs up in the air that read: &quot;The silent majority stands with Trump.&quot;&#xA;Trump Wants A Ruthless America&#xA;&quot;Believe me, I'll change things. And again, we're going to be so respected. I don't want to use the word 'feared,'&quot; he told the audience. But that is precisely what Trump wants: to be feared. His bid for the White House, long ridiculed, is a fight for a ruthless, brutal America. Behind his campaign slogan &quot;Make America great again!&quot; is the vision of a country that no longer cares about international treaties, ethnic minorities or established standards of decency.&#xA;Trump wants to attack head-first again. The 69-year-old embodies a new harshness and brutality, and both a physical and emotional crudeness. Trump has launched an uprising of the indecent, one that is now much bigger than he himself, a popular movement of white, conservative America that after eight years under Democratic President Barack Obama, yearns for a leader who will usher in the counter-revolution.&#xA;Former Obama campaign manager David Axelrod wrote recently that Trump's success is based on the same principle as the campaign victories of his former boss. In fact, he added, he had explained this recipe for success to Obama himself when he first ran for president: When a president leaves office after eight years, voters tend to prefer a candidate who is as different as possible from the incumbent, in terms of politics, character and habits.&#xA;By that logic, Obama the integrator, who fought against discrimination against blacks and gays, would be followed by a President Trump who stirs up hatred against minorities and claims that &quot;political correctness&quot; is the greatest threat to the United States. While Obama sought to explain complex problems, often sounding like an intellectual in the process, studies have shown that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade reading level. Problems, according to Trump, are &quot;totally easy&quot; to solve. And while Obama appealed to the common &quot;we&quot; in his campaign slogan &quot;Yes, we can!&quot; Trump's version reads &quot;Yes, I can!&quot; -- the solution of a strong leader.&#xA;Currently, America is running the risk of falling for a self-proclaimed leader with a low opinion of fundamental democratic values. Shortly before the Iowa Caucuses on Monday, all national polls showed Trump as the leading Republican candidate by a wide margin. He is also polling at the top of the Republican field in almost every state in the country. In Iowa itself, with its large religious population, the race could end up being a close contest between Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Christian hardliner.&#xA;Desire for a Strong Man at the Top&#xA;Trump takes every opportunity in this campaign to portray his country as a down-and-out weakling. According to his strategy, when a nation's feeling of self-worth has hit rock bottom, it experiences a growing desire to overcome the &quot;status quo&quot; -- and for a strong man at the top.&#xA;Trump is a unique figure. He is so wealthy that his campaign is almost entirely self-financed. Thanks to his colorful life as a New York real estate mogul and star of the reality TV show &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; he enters the presidential race with a celebrity factor like no other candidate before him.&#xA;But his most unique characteristic is his lack of scruples. When speaking about his amiable rival Jeb Bush, he has often said that Bush is such a &quot;low-energy person&quot; that no one can even look at him anymore without seeking signs of his lack of energy. Trump has repeatedly said that Marco Rubio, another Republican contender, &quot;sweats a lot,&quot; which, according to Trump, would be a little embarrassing for a president who has to negotiate with &quot;strong leaders like Vladimir Putin.&quot; He recently began claiming that his strongest rival at the moment, Ted Cruz, lacks the legal qualification to become president because he was born on Canadian soil. And last year he tweeted: &quot;If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?&quot; All of this profanity and unscrupulousness would have forced anyone else to resign. But for his millions of supporters, they are further evidence of Trump's boldness and strength.&#xA;&quot;I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?,&quot; Trump said at a rally in Iowa a week ago Saturday. He mimicked shooting a pistol with his finger and added: &quot;It's like, incredible!&quot;&#xA;No Longer the Laughing Stock&#xA;Salon.com wrote: &quot;(Trump) embodies that well-worn if still stinging observation about the country he hails from: that 'America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without passing through civilization.'&quot;&#xA;Trump announced his candidacy just over seven months ago. Since then, much has been written and said about his hairstyle. His plain and sometimes embarrassing statements, his muddled speeches and his incomprehensible narcissism have been a source of amusement. There are lists of the most outrageous statements Trump has made in the past, such as this one about women: &quot;You know, it doesn't really matter what (the media) write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.&quot;&#xA;But his candidacy ceased to be amusing long ago. Trump's demands are too extreme for that, and his view of the world and humanity too dangerous. And the chances are too great that he will be named as the Republican presidential candidate. Some polls show that Trump even stands a realistic chance of winning the White House in a possible face-off with Hillary Clinton. The combination of his views and the possibility that he could soon hold the planet's most powerful office make him the most dangerous man in the world at the moment.&#xA;For a long time, neither Republican Party officials nor the media recognized the true dimensions of the movement that Trump was forming. They continued to poke fun at him, even as he was creating a revolutionary mood on the right margin of society. Now it could be too late, and Trump could be the one getting the last laugh.&#xA;Like it or not, it is time to take Donald John Trump seriously. So what can be said about the character of this man who is determined to capture the White House? And what could America and the rest of the world expect if he truly became the 45th president of the United States?&#xA;Fascist Characteristics&#xA;New Yorker writer George Packer's book &quot;The Unwinding&quot; describes the gradual economic and, more importantly, moral decline of the United States. It is perhaps the most astute book about the country's condition today. Sitting at Lafayette Grand Café &amp; Bakery in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, Packer says that Trump now exhibits several of the characteristics of a fascist.&#xA;In the past, as a reality TV star, Trump had to come across as somewhat likeable, says Packer. But now that he is playing the fascist, he suddenly resembles one, with his grim face, his pursed lips and the threatening and intimidating look in his eyes.&#xA;It's no accident that Trump expresses great admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, who seems to impress him far more than politicians seeking to champion the values of democracy with their painstaking and often vain search for compromises.&#xA;&quot;He is a nicer person than I am,&quot; Trump said of the Russian president. &quot;In terms of leadership, he's getting an A.&quot; The reason, according to Trump, is that Putin is &quot;making mincemeat out of our president.&quot;&#xA;Putin returned the compliment in December, when he said: &quot;He's a really brilliant and talented person, without any doubt. He is the absolute front-runner in the presidential race.&quot; Trump, who judges people purely by whether or not they praise him, promptly shot back: &quot;When people call you brilliant, it's always good, especially when the person heads up Russia.&quot;&#xA;Inflaming Tensions&#xA;Packer says many Europeans are currently looking at Trump's success and thinking: &quot;Those Americans are crazy!&quot; But Trump isn't some strange US mutation, says Packer, who instead sees him as being evocative of European right-wing populists, à la Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orbán in Hungary.&#xA;While politicians like Le Pen and Orbán inveigh against &quot;Brussels,&quot; Trump rails against &quot;Washington&quot; as the symbol of a degenerate political system &quot;that doesn't get things done anymore.&quot; Just like his European counterparts, Trump is calling for isolation in the form of protective tariffs, entry bans and border walls. He inflames tensions against ethnic minorities and offers anxious citizens the authoritarian vision of a strongman who will solve all problems on his own -- while ignoring democratic conventions. Trump is presumably only the shrillest and most prominent embodiment of a trend that is becoming pervasive throughout the Western world.&#xA;Packer sees the 2008 financial crisis, which caused parts of the US economy to unravel and deprived millions of Americans of their economic foundation, as the main reason many Americans are receptive to a man like Trump. The economy has been growing again since then, but in absurdly unfair ways, says Packer, as inequality becomes more and more glaring. According to Packer, many Americans feel they have been left alone with their concerns, and they feel disconnected and betrayed.&#xA;The current primary race underscores how much this frustration has already changed the country. It has enabled Bernie Sanders, an extreme leftist by American standards, to become a serious threat to Hillary Clinton. And it is preparing the ground for Trump's campaign against all the elites, even though Trump himself has spent his entire life as a member of the country's economic elite.&#xA;Many Americans, especially whites and those with relatively little education, are now more receptive than ever to audacious promises and simplistic solutions. But they are also receptive to a form of politics that blames immigrants and minorities for their own fate, and for the race-baiting that has been part of every authoritarian movement to date. Trump offers all of these things, and he offers them more skillfully, professionally and self-confidently than all other candidates.&#xA;'It's a Miracle Trump Didn't Invent the Selfie'&#xA;Michael D'Antonio is sitting in an Applebee's fast-food restaurant on Long Island, speaking quietly. He's a cheerful, thoughtful man with a white beard, the polar opposite of Trump. D'Antonio has delved a lot deeper than most others into Donald Trump's world.&#xA;D'Antonio recently wrote a biography of Trump, who was enthusiastic about the project and gave his cooperation -- at least initially. Trump granted the author several interviews, which were usually held in his penthouse inside the Trump Tower, behind the kinds of double doors that would normally be used in castles. D'Antonio was granted free access to Trump's family and associates, and spoke with his grown children and all three of his wives. But when Trump realized that D'Antonio was also one of his critics, he immediately canceled the project.&#xA;&quot;What I noticed immediately in my first visit was that there were no books,&quot; says D'Antonio. &quot;A huge palace and not a single book.&quot; He asked Trump whether there was a book that had influenced him. &quot;I would love to read,&quot; Trump replied. &quot;I've had many best sellers, as you know, and 'The Art of the Deal' was one of the biggest-selling books of all time.&quot; Soon Trump was talking about &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; Trump called it &quot;the No. 1 show on television,&quot; a reality TV show in which, in 14 seasons, he played himself and humiliated candidates vying for the privilege of a job within his company. In the interview, Trump spent what seemed like an eternity talking about how fabulous and successful he is, but he didn't name a single book that he hadn't written.&#xA;&quot;Trump doesn't read,&quot; D'Antonio says in the restaurant. &quot;He hasn't absorbed anything serious and profound about American society since his college days. And to be honest, I don't even think he read in college.&quot; When Trump was asked who his foreign policy advisers were, he replied: &quot;Well, I watch the shows.&quot; He was referring to political talk shows on TV.&#xA;In all of the conversations about his life, Trump seemed like a little boy, says D'Antonio. &quot;Like a six-year-old boy who comes home from the playground and can hardly wait to announce that he shot the decisive goal.&quot;&#xA;According to D'Antonio, American society revolves around two things: ambition and self-promotion. This is why Trump is one of the most appropriate heroes he can imagine for the country, he adds, noting that no one is more ambitious and narcissistic. &quot;It's a miracle Trump didn't invent the selfie.&quot;&#xA;The Dark Side of Trump's Narcissism&#xA;During an appearance two weeks at a Toyota dealership in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a young woman in the crowd said she had two questions for Trump. The first one was about the college financing system. Trump's reply contained the word &quot;college,&quot; at any rate. This was her second question: &quot;Can I take a selfie with you?&quot; The owner of the dealership felt that the question was inappropriate and quickly said that perhaps she could do it later. But Trump was already saying &quot;Of course! Of course!&quot; and waved the woman onto the stage.&#xA;His biographer talks about the dark sides of Trump's self-absorption. &quot;Trump lacks any self-irony, any form of critical self-perception.&quot; The entire family is like that, he explains. When he tried to joke with Trump's children about their father's penchant for gold and glitter in his buildings, none of them understood what he was getting at. &quot;They don't notice when something is ridiculous,&quot; says D'Antonio. &quot;This is the most telling characteristic of the entire Trump clan: the persistent denial of reflection.&quot;&#xA;But what worried him the most, says D'Antonio, is Trump's belief that he is genetically superior to most people in the world. In all of their conversations, he notes, Trump kept returning to the notion that by virtue of his birth, he is simply better than other people in many areas -- from playing golf to being a businessman. &quot;I'm a big believer in natural ability,&quot; Trump said.&#xA;His son, Donald Trump Jr., shares his father's conviction. He said he was a firm believer in the concept of breeding, in &quot;race-horse theory.&quot; Then he pointed at the ceiling with his finger, in the direction of his father's office. &quot;He's an incredibly accomplished guy, my mother's incredibly accomplished, she's an Olympian, so I'd like to believe genetically I'm predisposed to (be) better than average.&quot;&#xA;Apparently this sort of belief also helps Trump portray himself to voters as a strong man, as the person who will save the country.&#xA;A Core Element of Racism&#xA;In early January, the stadium at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, was filled with 6,500 Trump supporters. Rose Hamid, a Muslim woman, waited for the right moment to express her opposition to Trump. Hamid and her friends chose a spot in the bleachers, directly behind the lectern. They had planned to stand up when Trump said something hateful. When he began railing against Syrian refugees, Hamid pulled out a yellow Star of David with the word Muslim printed on it and stuck it to her T-shirt. She stood up and folded her hands. Her Jewish friend also rose to her feet, and they both stood there, in silent protest against the stigmatization of religions.&#xA;The crowd erupted into indignation within seconds. Trump's fans stuck their fists in the air and drowned out Hamid, as if she were a criminal, shouting &quot;Trump! Trump!&quot; Then Trump signaled to the security guards to remove Hamid from the room. She didn't resist. Since the incident, however, she has known what it feels like to be chased away by Trump and his supporters.&#xA;A few days later Hamid, 56, is sitting in a row house in a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina, talking about the January evening when Trump had her escorted out. Hamid is a proud Muslim woman who wears a headscarf, even while working as a flight attendant, and she has never been criticized for it. She was raised Catholic and converted to Islam in her mid-20s. A copy of the Ten Commandments sits on her bookshelf and a verse from the Koran hangs on the wall. She believes in the diversity of religions. That was what she wanted to say to Trump when she heard he was coming to her area.&#xA;At first Hamid, like many others, didn't take Trump seriously. But this changed when Trump, after the attacks in Paris, proposed the establishment of a database of all Muslims in the country. He later called for a &quot;complete shutdown of all Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.&quot; It seems to trouble neither Trump nor his supporters that the First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion.&#xA;Racism has since become a core element of his campaign, but it has only intensified in recent months. At first, Trump was only talking about the need to stop illegal immigrants. Only when he realized that this was what got him the most applause did he become more radical. In June, he said that Mexico is &quot;bringing drugs, crime and rapists&quot; to the United States, and that he would &quot;build a great, great wall on our southern border,&quot; and &quot;I will have Mexico pay for that wall!&quot; He also announced that he would deport all 11 million illegal immigrants within two years. For his fans, Trump's &quot;great, great wall,&quot; which he compares with the Great Wall of China, has become a symbol of a well-fortified America.&#xA;Goading and Ridicule&#xA;Almost every evening, Trump goads his supporters to shout down protestors or throw them out of his rallies. He often ridicules these individuals from the lectern. If one of them happens to be on the heavy side, he pokes fun at &quot;that fat guy,&quot; which fans interpret as a signal -- that Trump won't mind if they get a little physical with the protester.&#xA;When a TV host recently asked Trump, who was sitting with his back to his fans, whether he was serious when he said that he would also &quot;take out&quot; the wives and children of terrorists, Trump replied: &quot;We have to be more vigilant, and we have to be much tougher.&quot; The crowd behind him cheered. At a rally in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, his supporters attacked a black protester, while others shouted &quot;shoot him,&quot; &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; and &quot;light the motherfucker on fire!&quot;&#xA;These are the moments when it becomes clear how brutal Trump can be. Trump biographer D'Antonio learned that Trump had always sought out bodyguards who looked like hoodlums and thugs -- to put the fear of God in people.&#xA;&quot;I tried to look Trump's supporters in the eye, but it was impossible,&quot; says Rose Hamid. &quot;There was a strange emptiness there.&quot; Trump is changing the country and its people, she adds, and the other candidates, faced with his poll numbers, are revising their own rhetoric. Indeed, this is what worries Hamid. &quot;Trump emboldens people to do things they normally wouldn't dare to do.&quot;&#xA;A study by pollster Matthew MacWilliams shows that what Trump's supporters have in common, more than anything else, is the desire for authority. MacWilliams asked people whether they preferred a respectful, obedient and well-behaved child or an independent and curious one. Those who tend to favor the former are seen as being authoritarian. Trump was the only candidate strongly favored by the respondents with authoritarian ideas.&#xA;This group offers tremendous potential for Trump, says MacWilliams, noting that not only 49 percent of Republicans but also 39 percent of independent voters showed a penchant for the authoritarian. &quot;Trump's support is firmly rooted in American authoritarianism and, once awakened, it is a force to be reckoned with,&quot; MacWilliams recently wrote on the website Politico.&#xA;It makes sense that Trump doesn't seem to care much about freedom of religion or other cornerstones of democracy. In his rhetoric, he could hardly be more contemptuous of the Congress in Washington. Freedom of the press also seems to annoy him. And before every event, he has his announcer point out that he respects free speech &quot;almost as much&quot; as the right to bear arms.&#xA;On some evenings, Trump even has potential audience members questioned about their views. Before his appearance in Burlington, Vermont, a security official dressed in black stood in the lobby and asked every visitor: &quot;Are you a supporter of Mr. Trump?&quot; Those who said no or were undecided were turned away, even if they had tickets to the event. In a democracy, an election campaign is supposed to be an opinion-forming process. But in Trump's case, people are either for him or they are thrown out.&#xA;Trump uses the term &quot;the lying press,&quot; now famous in Germany, in many of his appearances. &quot;The journalists are miserable people,&quot; he says to his supporters, pointing to the corner where the cameras are. At his events, journalists are herded together into a fenced area, under the watchful eyes of zealous guards. The biggest paradox of this campaign is that Trump, while sharply berating the media, is the one who benefits the most from the coverage it provides him. The major TV networks devote more airtime to him to Trump than to all his rivals combined. He is the only Republican candidate who provides the networks with the ratings they crave, and yet he is also the one who mocks them for that very mechanism.&#xA;His last-minute refusal to participate in a televised debate hosted by the right-wing Fox News network last week, because he felt unfairly treated by Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators, is not only a first in the history of American election campaigns. It is also the latest climax in the game Trump is playing with the media.&#xA;What To Expect from a President Trump&#xA;What would America look like with a man like this at the helm? And what could the world expect from a President Trump? He has yet to present a comprehensive platform for his presidency. The constant questions about content annoy Trump, and he would prefer it if people would simply trust him. Trump often complains that it's always the journalists who ask questions about his policies. He claims voters don't care very much about that sort of thing. Where others have strategy papers, Trump has his gut feeling. Nevertheless, something resembling an agenda can be deduced from his interviews and speeches.&#xA;If we take him at his word, the United States will soon be surrounded by a high wall. The country will only be able to engage in limited trade, because the tariffs will be so high. Eleven million immigrants will have left the United States in cloak-and-dagger operations. The days of the United States as a country of immigrants would be over, once and for all.&#xA;Those who have experienced this man's temperament know just how thin-skinned and aggressive Trump can be when criticized or provoked, and how mercilessly and excessively he pursues revenge. One shudders to think what could happen if a man like that had his finger on the button of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. &quot;An ally, let's say from Europe, who didn't follow him into war would be considered a traitor by Trump and would have to expect massive retribution,&quot; D'Antonio believes.&#xA;If there's a basic idea behind Trump's campaign, it's his own leadership strength. &quot;We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning,&quot; Trump has pledged. &quot;I have so much energy, it's almost ridiculous.&quot; He seems to want to govern in the same way that he became a billionaire -- despite a few bankruptcies along the way.&#xA;Although he previously held liberal positions on some divisive issues, like weapons possession and abortion, he is now presenting himself as a firm opponent of abortion and a huge fan of guns. He's raised other reasonable ideas in the past as well: He once called for a government-financed healthcare system that would be accessible for everyone. He also advocated for a tax on the super rich to reduce US government debt. Indeed, his Republican opponents have been reminding the public of these statements in the form of video clips aimed at damaging the candidate. They include sentences like, &quot;I probably identify more as Democrat.&quot; For his part, though, Trump acts as if this past never even existed. He presents his new, ultraconservative positions in the most populist of ways and with even greater determination.&#xA;An Odd Worldview&#xA;Trump the entrepreneur does business all around the world. Ironically, however, as president he would limit any free trade not conducted according to his own rules. In order to shrink the trade deficit with China, he proposes imposing high punitive tariffs on Chinese exports to the US. He promises to bring back all the American jobs that have been lost to Asia or Mexico as a result of globalization. Voters are expected to trust that Trump will be as effective a diplomatic negotiator as he was a business negotiator. &quot;I will be the greatest jobs president that God has ever created,&quot; Trump boasted last summer.&#xA;His foreign policy essentially boils down to a bizarre mix of isolationism and a simultaneous show of superiority through a military build-up. &quot;I'm the most militaristic person there is,&quot; Trump says.&#xA;When it comes to international politics, Trump prefers to rely on his own personal experiences and impulses than on textbooks. For example, he doesn't consider North Korea to be an American problem, but rather one which China must solve. He offers a similar approach for addressing the war in Syria, where he feels the problems should be dealt with locally and that there is no need for intervention.&#xA;Trump nevertheless says he wants to &quot;bomb the hell out of&quot; the Islamic State (IS), or as his newly won endorsee Sarah Palin expressed on stage just over a week ago, he would send American &quot;warriors&quot; to &quot;kick ISIS's ass.&quot; To accomplish that, Trump claims he wants to give US generals free hand, saying they already know what needs to be done. What Trump hasn't revealed, unfortunately, is how alliances are even supposed to be forged with Muslim countries against the Islamic State by a United States that places Muslims under a state of general suspicions and refuses to allow them to travel into the country as he has proposed doing.&#xA;Trump has announced he will take a hardline approach on terrorists, but he also says he doesn't want to be interventionist. His gut feeling is that Americans will reject interventions with uncertain outcomes. During his campaign, he has often repeated the fact that he heavily criticized the Iraq war in 2003. The way things look right now, the world is going to have to brace for a US foreign policy based on gut feelings.&#xA;Is There any Stopping Trump?&#xA;The question now is whether such a political course, and indeed a President Donald J. Trump, can even still be prevented. And who could stop him? The possibilities include the Republicans themselves, a party Trump seems to work with based on his mood or whim. And then, of course, there are the Democrats, whose probable candidate, Hillary Clinton, Trump will likely have to square off against in the main election. But neither side can be fully trusted to defeat Trump.&#xA;Never before has the grand, time-honored Republican Party been as helpless and hapless as it is right now. The party's leadership had sought an establishment candidate like Jeb Bush or the younger Marco Rubio. But Trump?&#xA;&quot;We are in total chaos,&quot; says Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush. He says the Republicans are already divided and that a Trump candidacy could spell the end of the Grand Old Party. When Wehner talks about Trump, it sounds as if he's referring to the head of some dictatorship. &quot;Trump is erratic. He is emotionally unstable, has authoritarian tendencies and a certain cruelty. He is a toxic figure, a demagogue. Trump would cause a lot of damage to the Republican Party. If he won the nomination it would be a hostile takeover. We must prevent it.&quot;&#xA;Some already view Trump as the founder of a new political movement -- &quot;Trumpism&quot; -- that has little in common with the traditional conservatism on the right.&#xA;The level of frustration among many Republican officials was on display in mid-January during a speech given at an internal meeting of party leaders in South Carolina by Holland Redfield, a member of the Republican National Committee, who said the GOP was being &quot;almost terrorized&quot; by Trump and that &quot;there is a limit to loyalty.&quot;&#xA;The question being discussed the most right now within the party is what the GOP's response should be if Trump wins the first primaries. Should he be embraced in order to share in the success? Or should the party take a more hostile approach in the hope that a more reliable candidate may ultimately prevail?&#xA;Currently, the faction that views Trump as representing the downfall of conservatism is dominating. Strategy papers are being circulated within the party addressing how officials should counter Trump's arguments. The National Review, a respected conservative political magazine, even published a plea to prominent Republicans under the headline, &quot; Against Trump .&quot;&#xA;Is the Tide Turning in Trump's Favor?&#xA;Within the party base, however, there are a growing number of voices reminding that America is the country of freedom and that politics is an open competition. &quot;If Trump is able to gather the most votes for himself, then he should also be our candidate,&quot; says Congressman Mick Mulvaney. Mulvaney is a Rand Paul backer, but he considers the will of the party base to be crucial.&#xA;Inside the party, there's growing sentiment that Trump might stand a good chance even against Hillary Clinton. &quot;In the same way that Reagan brought renewal to the Republican Party and made it electable for Democrats, I think there are many conservative Democrats who would support Trump,&quot; says Jeffrey Lord, a former White House aide to Reagan.&#xA;The more influential Republicans are still keeping a low-profile right now, but if you speak to men like Newt Gingrich, it sounds like the Republicans will ultimately fall into line with Trump. During the 1990s, Gingrich led the Republicans in the House of Representatives and launched the &quot;Republican Revolution.&quot; In 2012, he also ran as a Republican candidate in the primaries, though his campaign was ultimately a flop. On his way to Iowa, Gingrich took some time to talk to SPIEGEL while he was waiting for his flight.&#xA;Gingrich still has a clear recollection of Trump asking to meet with him in January 2015. The two had breakfast together in Des Moines on the sidelines of an event they were attending in the city. Trump spoke for the first time about his idea to run. Gingrich believes people underestimate Trump. He tells a story of the ice skating rink in New York's Central Park in order to illustrate Trump's skills.&#xA;In 1980, the city had closed the skating rink for renovations. The work was only supposed to take two years, but by 1986, it still wasn't finished. That's when Trump showed up. He convinced Mayor Ed Koch to let him take over the project, promising that the rink would be up and running within three months. In return, he asked for the concession rights. Exactly three months later, Trump unveiled the new ice skating rink in a nationally televised ceremony. &quot;Donald Trump is a very talented man,&quot; says Gingrich.&#xA;But does he stand a chance against Hillary Clinton? &quot;Of course,&quot; says Gingrich. &quot;America is a huge country. Anything can happen.&quot;&#xA;Tackling Clinton&#xA;This is evident on a bitter cold January evening in Burlington, Vermont. A line has formed in front of a local theater. Mary Loyer, 44, and her son Tim, 28, are hoping to catch a glimpse of Trump. Tim works as a waiter, Mary is unemployed. They're supporters of the left-wing democrat Bernie Sanders, a long-time mayor of Burlington. But Mary says something that one hears over and over again on the campaign trail: &quot;If it came down to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, I don't know who I'd vote for. But it wouldn't be Clinton.&quot;&#xA;&quot;Hillary is corrupt,&quot; Tim says. &quot;She does what Big Money wants her to do, and she's a flip-flopper.&quot; Sanders and Trump have more in common than it seems, he adds: &quot;Both of them are the only politicians who say what they think and do what they say.&quot; His mom nods.&#xA;For a long time, the Clinton camp fantasized about taking on Trump. The way they saw it, it would be Clinton, an experienced, middle-of-the-road candidate, versus Trump, the radical leader of the old, white guard. Many democratic strategists viewed such a matchup as a unique opportunity. Vice President Joe Biden said if Trump won the Republican nomination, Hillary Clinton would &quot;win in a walk.&quot;&#xA;In the meantime, it has become apparent that Clinton can't even rely on the unconditional support of her own people. For many, she represents a political system that is symbiotically entwined with Big Business. Trump, the big capitalist, however, bills himself as someone who is not for sale. He doesn't accept big donations and doesn't owe anyone anything. The fact that he, unlike Clinton, has never held a political office is an advantage in this election campaign.&#xA;Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg is one of the few in his party who openly addresses how difficult it could be for Clinton to handle a Trump candidacy. The founder of the progressive think tank &quot;New Democratic Network&quot; believes that the widespread frustration about the status quo within the American electorate and his ability to handle the modern media better than anyone else in the race would make Trump a strong opponent in the general election. &quot;Trump would be a lot harder to defeat than most of us think&quot;, he says. &quot;There were more than a dozend Republican candidates and he basically destroyed all of them. It is unbelievable what he did.&quot;&#xA;But many democrats aren't panicking yet. They're betting on Clinton's campaign coming around and gaining momentum once she secures the nomination. At the same time, they are anxious that this could become the dirtiest duel in the history of American presidential campaigns.&#xA;If it does, Roger Stone will be the man to blame. The unscrupulousness that has come to define Trump's campaign is largely Stone's doing. He learned the tricks of the trade from Richard Nixon in the 1970s, and later helped Ronald Reagan get into the White House. By the end of the 1980s, Stone was already trying to convince his friend Trump to run for president. Almost everything Trump knows about politics and power, he learned from Stone -- including the art of manipulation. Stone is considered a master of defamatory rumors.&#xA;Stone also helped Trump lay the foundations for his campaign last spring. Then in summer, he was abruptly fired. Trump's people cited a disagreement between the two, but observers now believe the split could have been staged, a trick.&#xA;&quot;I remain an unabashed Trump supporter and Trump enthusiast,&quot; Stone said when reached on the phone last autumn. &quot;I just finally made a decision that I could have a greater impact on the outside. Trump is still a very close friend.&quot; As before, the two talk regularly and Stone obviously gives Trump important advice. And just like old times, Stone spends nearly every evening on TV touting Trump and his &quot;movement.&quot;&#xA;Since he is no longer an official member of Trump's campaign team, Stone has the freedom to be even more ruthless in his derision of Trump's opponents, without the risk of the mud-slinging coming back to haunt the candidate. Trump biographer D'Antonio describes Stone as &quot;pure evil.&quot; He is a &quot;deeply disgusting person,&quot; someone who doesn't understand anything but &quot;brute force.&quot;&#xA;Stone's favorite victim is Hillary Clinton. His recently published book, &quot;The Clintons' War on Women,&quot; is a nasty piece of work. But it could also be seen as a blueprint for Trump's campaign against Hillary. Without credible proof, Stone claims that Chelsea Clinton is not Bill's biological daughter and that Bill has fathered at least one son with a black prostitute. Stone calls the former president a serial rapist and Hillary his henchwoman. He also suggests that Hillary has the death of a man who knew about Bill's escapades on her conscience.&#xA;In television interviews, Stone claims Hillary is the &quot;point person in the terror campaign to intimidate and bully women into silence.&quot; That she once waged a &quot;nuts and sluts campaign to discredit Monica Lewinsky to make it her fault that she was seduced by a man three times her age.&quot; He has also stated that &quot;Bill rapes women physically and Hillary rapes them psychologically.&quot; He claims Hillary Clinton &quot;has no right to call herself an advocate for women and girls.&quot; Trump recently released a campaign video with a similar message.&#xA;&quot;The Clintons are money-making opportunists and criminals,&quot; Stone says. Their foundation is nothing more than a &quot;luxury travel service to augment the lifestyles of Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.&quot; People with those kinds of friends and advisers don't leave much to the imagination as to their character, he says.&#xA;A Threat to World Peace&#xA;If the most powerful office in the world wasn't at stake, all this wouldn't be nearly as dangerous. Germany has been too busy dealing with the supposed threat posed by refugees in recent months to appreciate what's really been going on across the Atlantic. Despite their differences, the US and Germany share an unshakeable faith in democracy and freedom. But nothing would be more harmful to the idea of the West and world peace than if Donald Trump were to be elected president. Compared to that, the America of George W. Bush would seem like a land of logic and reason in retrospect.&#xA;Bush, to his credit, never compared migrants to poisonous snakes -- something Trump did recently at a rally in Pensacola, Florida. Later that night, Trump addressed what has been one of his favorite topics lately: Europe's refugee crisis. &quot;Just talk to the folks over in Germany,&quot; he said. &quot;Europe is being destroyed.&quot;&#xA;When he puts on his reading glasses, the audience goes quiet. &quot;Just listen to this,&quot; he says, pulling a piece of paper from his pocket. He printed out the lyrics to &quot;The Snake,&quot; an old soul hit from Al Wilson. The song is about a snake, half frozen from the cold, that asks a woman to be let inside. The woman takes pity on the animal and holds it to her bosom, upon which the snake bites and poisons her.&#xA;Trump reads the lyrics aloud passionately, as if he were auditioning for a role. &quot;Oh, shut up silly woman,&quot; he says, imitating the snake: &quot;You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.&quot; The crowd cheers. They're over the moon. Trump just stares back at them. &quot;We're gonna get bit.&quot;&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

But instead of closing its Aegean coast to migrant smugglers, Ankara shut its border with Syria, making it difficult for those threatened by the war to leave." content="Unexpected Consequences of German Dependence on Turkey&#xA;Unintended Consequences: Merkel's Reliance on Turkey Makes Life Worse for Refugees&#xA;By Peter Müller , Maximilian Popp and Christoph Schult&#xA;AP&#xA;The construction of a security wall along the border between Turkey and Syria: Increased controls mean that many trying to escape Assad's barrel bombs are unable to get out of the country.&#xA;Chancellor Angela Merkel asked Turkey to help reduce the number of refugees coming to Europe. But instead of closing its Aegean coast to migrant smugglers, Ankara shut its border with Syria, making it difficult for those threatened by the war to leave.&#xA;Suddenly, the connection breaks off. Nadim Shami* presses the telephone against his ear and cries: &quot;Maryam! Can you hear me?&quot; He calls the number of the smugglers, but nobody answers. Nadim Shami is sitting in a teahouse in the town of Antakya, on the Turkish-Syrian border, and taps his fingers on the table. He's waiting for a sign that his wife is still alive. Four hours earlier, Maryam Shami had set off from a refugee camp in northwestern Syria together with her two sons Yasin and Mohammed and her daughter Samira.* A migrant smuggler brought the family to the Turkish border, where Maryam Shami and her children hid in the bushes until darkness fell. The last words Nadim Shami heard from his wife on the telephone were: &quot;We're heading out.&quot;&#xA;Nadim Shami, 28, used to work as a mechanic in the northwestern Syrian city of Idlib, but last summer, he fled the violence to Turkey hoping to find work and an apartment in Antakya before bringing his wife and children over to join him. He hadn't thought that Turkey would close off its border with Syria.&#xA;That too, though, has become a side effect of Angela Merkel's refugee policies. For months, the chancellor has faced rising pressure to reduce the number of people coming to Germany on the search for security and a bit of prosperity. Recently, in fact, speculation has been mounting in Berlin that Merkel may soon be forced out of office . Large numbers of conservative politicians -- both with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union -- have demanded that the chancellor close the German border to refugees. Merkel, though, has thus far refused, hoping instead for help from her European partners and, in particular, from Turkey.&#xA;The chancellor has one main goal she would like to achieve by the beginning of March: The number of refugees coming from Turkey to Greece should drop significantly. If that happens, Merkel is prepared to take in set quotas of refugees from Turkey -- even if not all EU member states agree to help.&#xA;Turkey has begun making efforts to combat the refugee crisis, but differently than Merkel had hoped. Rather that increasing patrols on the coast, where many refugees jump on boats heading for the nearby Greek islands, Ankara has closed the border to Syria.&#xA;A Two-Fold Failure&#xA;The result is that precisely those Syrians for whom survival is the number one priority are being denied the necessary protection. The many other migrants, including those who have left their home countries or third countries primarily for economic reasons, can continue to enter Turkey and travel onwards to Europe. Merkel's Turkey strategy is thus in danger of two-fold failure: It could make it more difficult for Syrians to flee the Assad regime's barrel bombs while at the same time failing to prevent the continued arrival of migrants to Europe.&#xA;The European border control agency Frontex has its headquarters on the 11th floor of the Warsaw Spire, located in the heart of the Polish capital. On the computer screens in the &quot;Situation Center,&quot; the fate of refugees in the Aegean are reduced to a row of green dots. Border officials can monitor the routes of individual boats and keep an eye on the situation on the EU's external border.&#xA;Frontex head Fabrice Leggeri believes that the refugee drama between Turkey and the European Union will continue. &quot;Despite the bad weather, between 2,000 and 3,000 people are arriving in Greece each day,&quot; he says. Leggeri is of the opinion that Ankara needs to do more. &quot;Turkey has to make it more difficult for the migrant smugglers,&quot; he says.&#xA;But is that possible? Since the EU-Turkey summit at the end of November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sent more security personnel to the Aegean coast and increased the number of raids on migrant smugglers. In 2015, Turkish police arrested 341 smugglers, almost four times the number taken into custody in 2014. But Turkey's Aegean coast is around 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) long, making it a virtual impossibility to completely close it off to the smugglers.&#xA;&quot;Who cares about the controls?&quot; says Ibrahim Hamza.* The men in the lobby of Izmir's Palast Hotel laugh. It smells like sweat and cigarette smoke. Hamza swipes the display of his mobile phone and sees that Turkey's weather service forecasts a night without rain or wind. &quot;In a few hours,&quot; says Hamza, &quot;we'll start the next tour.&quot;&#xA;Hamza, 30, is a handyman from the southern Syria city of Daraa who now smuggles refugees from Izmir, located on Turkey's Aegean coast. The port town is a hub for migrants from around the world. Hamza is wearing a hoodie and a beard, and has a tattoo on his forearm. He once fought for the Free Syrian Army against the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, but two years ago, after his two brothers were killed in battle, he left Syria for Turkey.&#xA;Turkish government controls, Hamza says, haven't had much of an impact on his business. The smuggling ring that he works for, he says, has contacts within the police and government agencies. For each tour, Hamza pays 3,000 to the police so that his group can pass without being checked -- and he simply avoids the military posts on the coast. Since January, the smugglers have preferred new, more remote routes, to the sea. Once the refugees have reached the coast, it's too late: It takes but a few minutes to inflate the rafts. &quot;We will always find a way to smuggle refugees to Europe,&quot; says Hamza.&#xA;Disturbing Trend&#xA;The problem for Merkel, however, is not only to be found on the long, difficult-to-monitor coastline. In recent months, an increasing number of North Africans have been coming to Germany via Turkey. Whereas around 100 Moroccans reached Greece last September, for example, by December the number had risen to 2,800. The same trend can likewise be seen with the Algerians. Citizens of Maghreb states don't need a visa to travel to Turkey and simply fly to Istanbul. Indeed, one of the primary beneficiaries of the trend is the partially state-owned Turkish Airlines.&#xA;Refugees from Afghanistan, who now make up 20 percent of those arriving in Greece, represent a completely different problem. They arrive to Turkey by land, particularly from Iran, where around 2 million Afghans have fled. Officially, they need a visa to enter Turkey, but the mountainous border region is poorly monitored. Furthermore, it is part of the Kurdish areas, where the Turkish army is doing battle with the Kurdish rebel group PKK.&#xA;Officials in Berlin and Brussels are concerned that Turkey's military operation in the southeast is taking away financial and personnel resources that could otherwise be used to combat migrant smuggling on its west coast. But there are no indications that fighting with the Kurdish rebels will subside anytime soon. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu made it clear during his recent visit to Berlin that President Erdogan has no interest in de-escalation. On the contrary: Erdogan has announced his intention to &quot;annihilate&quot; the separatists.&#xA;REUTERS&#xA;German Chancellor Angela Merkel has become extremely dependent on Turkey in the refugee crisis.&#xA;That puts Merkel in the uncomfortable position of being dependent on a man who is not only leading a brutal war against the Kurds, but who is also systematically eroding press freedoms. During talks a week ago Friday, Merkel requested that Turkey finally fulfill its part of the agreement regarding the reduction of refugee numbers. Time is of the essence, Merkel said, with an eye to the growing resistance to her policies. It sounded almost imploring. Davutoglu responded pleasantly that he reads the German papers every day and is aware of the domestic political situation in Germany. But he made no concessions.&#xA;Ankara, in fact, has discovered the migrant issue as a lever in dealings with Merkel and the EU. In addition to financial assistance, Erdogan would like to force the Europeans into concessions when it comes to his country's EU accession negotiations.&#xA;'We Shouldn't Expect Any Miracles'&#xA;Yet even if such concessions were made, it doesn't change the fact that Turkey has little interest in having the refugees remain in their country in the long term. &quot;We shouldn't expect any miracles from Ankara,&quot; says one German diplomat.&#xA;At the same time, it's also not as if Turkey has done nothing. Since the beginning of the year, Syrian refugees have had the right to work legally in the country. Plus, Ankara introduced a requirement on Jan. 8 that Syrians coming from third states such as Jordan or Lebanon must have a visa to enter Turkey. From one day to the next, the German Embassy in Beirut cabled to Berlin, the number of flights from Beirut to Istanbul plunged from 25 to fewer than 10. Whereas 41,000 Syrians traveled to Turkey in the first week after the introduction of the visa requirement, in the second week, the number had fallen to 1,000.&#xA;Indeed, there have been positive steps, says EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who was just recently in Turkey. &quot;But we have made extremely clear that the EU expects very rapid and very involved actions by Turkey when it comes to the reduction of the refugee numbers: better controls on entry and exit, further steps on the visa front and last but not least, fighting the smugglers.&quot;&#xA;But the visa requirement has negative consequences as well. Because only very few Syrians receive a visa, the majority of refugees are now forced to enter Turkey by land. That, though, is becoming increasingly difficult. Turkey is extending its border wall with Syria by the day. Ankara has said that the border will remain open to Syrian refugees, but the official border crossings have been de facto closed. Refugees instead use alternative routes through the forests.&#xA;Nadim Shami says his wife has been stopped twice by Turkish soldiers during attempts to cross the border and sent back into Syria. Many refugees that SPIEGEL has spoken with report similar experiences: They claim to have been taken into custody by Turkish security forces and deported to Syria. Some say they suffered abuse.&#xA;Trying Again the Next Day&#xA;An engineering student from Deir-al-Zor in eastern Syria says he was locked up for two days in a military barracks near the Turkish border city of Reyhanli and claims he was given nothing to eat or drink during the ordeal. Instead, Turkish soldiers beat him, robbed him and finally put him on a bus with other refugees back across the border to Syria, he reports.&#xA;International law forbids the deportation of people into countries suffering from civil war if their lives may be at risk. In December, Amnesty International documented 130 cases of illegal deportations of refugees from Turkey to Syria and Iraq. The victims, according to Amnesty, were held in Turkish prisons for several weeks until they agreed to leave the country. Turkey has denied the accusations.&#xA;In the Antakya teahouse, Nadim Shamit buries his face in his hands. He hasn't slept for days and is consumed by self-doubt. Why did he leave for Turkey? Why did he leave his family behind? Late that night, he gets a call from his wife Maryam. She and the kids had to turn back at the Turkish border because of a storm. They plan to try again the next day.&#xA;* Names have been changed.&#xA;"/>

She achieved that ascent by taking over the reins together with Naftali Bennett of the national religious party Jewish Home, which has become the third-strongest party in Israel, attracting the votes of young Tel Aviv residents as well as radical settlers. The fact that the party is able to manage this balancing act is also due to Shaked's merits. She's smart, secular and radical and doesn't shy away from making razor-sharp -- some would even say racist -- comments.&#xA;She has risen to become one of the most admired and hated politicians in Israel. She's not the kind of person to wait for an elevator, instead obliging her entourage to take the stairs for her interview with SPIEGEL in the Justice Ministry in East Jerusalem. She offers a friendly smile, but speaks firmly -- at times raising her voice, particularly when the subject of Hamas in Gaza comes up in the conversation. The interview is conducted in English, but she sometimes switches to Hebrew since she feels more comfortable speaking in her mother tongue.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Minister Shaked, the Knesset is currently discussing a bill you proposed that would require NGOs funded by foreign governments to disclose the donations they receive. The law would primarily affect left-leaning peace and human rights groups. Is this an attack on Israeli democracy?&#xA;Shaked: This law does not hurt any democratic principles -- it does not harm the freedom of speech or the freedom of organization. We do not even limit the donations. It is just a transparency bill. The Israeli public has the right to know which organizations are representing foreign interests.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Your proposal is strongly reminiscent of similar laws by authoritarian regimes like Egypt or Russia. You once claimed that the United States has similar regulations, but the US ambassador to Israel just publicly contradicted that statement. Do you not fear that you could harm your country's reputation?&#xA;Shaked: It is inappropriate for a country to intervene in the internal issues of another country like this. I want to bring the discussion back to the main issue at hand: Why doesn't anyone address the substantive question of why other states blatantly interfere in Israel's internal affairs? Israel does not meddle in the affairs of other states in a similar way, so why do other countries feel entitled to do this to Israel? These actions violate Israeli sovereignty and I expect European Union member states to act differently.&#xA;SPIEGEL: So is your bill in fact targeting foreign governments?&#xA;Shaked: Every time I meet an ambassador, I bring to the a table a list of NGOs I think are acting against Israel, promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) or denouncing our soldiers. I ask from them to stop contributing to these specific NGOs. But, unfortunately, it does not help. I do not want countries that are friends of ours to contribute to such organizations.&#xA;SPIEGEL: So you are admitting that your proposal is about more than just transparency? Are you also trying to limit the work of certain critical organizations?&#xA;Shaked: No. I am talking about two different paths here. I am saying that I am trying to minimize the donations to these groups by talking to diplomats. The transparency bill also has the purpose of enabling the Israeli public and members of Knesset to know whose interests certain organizations represent.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Another institution you are criticizing for its alleged interference in Israeli politics is your country's Supreme Court.&#xA;Shaked: I am very proud of our Supreme Court -- it is one of the best worldwide. Nevertheless, since the 1990s, we have seen a certain imbalance in the relationship between the judiciary, the parliament and the government. The Supreme Court behaved in an activist way. We have to debate the degree to which such Supreme Court activism is appropriate.&#xA;SPIEGEL: A member of parliament belonging to your party demanded a few months ago that the Supreme Court be demolished. You yourself are planning a bill that would enable the Knesset to overrule decisions made by the judges -- thereby enabling it to implement laws that have been declared unlawful. It sounds like you want to strip the judiciary of its power.&#xA;Shaked: At issue here is a basic law which enables the Supreme Court to quash laws in extreme cases. Up until now, this right of the Supreme Court was not mentioned anywhere, but was just taken. At the same time, we want to enable the Knesset to overrule decisions of the Supreme Court. At the moment, we are discussing the necessary majority -- I support a majority of 61.&#xA;SPIEGEL: But that would enable the current government to reverse any decision made by the high court. The outcome is already obvious: You are seeking the greater influence of halakha (Jewish law) in lawmaking. But isn't this a renunciation of the secular state?&#xA;Shaked: I expect from our judges that their verdicts are also inspired by Talmudic law -- and not only by common law or European justice systems.&#xA;SPIEGEL: You are also a supporter of the controversial nation-state bill, which would define Israel first and foremost as a Jewish state. Critics fear democratic principles could be subordinated to religious ones in the future.&#xA;Shaked: We already have two very strong democratic tools -- the two basic laws of personal liberties and human rights. I think we should also provide the judiciary with another tool so that they can rely on the fact that Israel is a Jewish state in verdicts.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Many Jewish communities abroad fear Israel is becoming less and less pluralistic. They don't feel represented by your policies. Shouldn't Israel be taking these voices more seriously?&#xA;Shaked: Jewish communities in the diaspora are very important to Israel and we are open to a dialogue with them. It is bitter for us to see the process of assimilation, the mixing of Jewish and non-Jewish. But when it comes to the relations of state and religions, the basics have not changed since Rabin's times. As the head of a religious party, I am not in favor of civil marriage or the full recognition of non-Orthodox converts in Israel.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Officially, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still supports the two-state solution, but almost the entire government opposes it. Where do you stand on the issue?&#xA;Shaked: I think the gap between Israelis and Palestinians is too deep to be bridged in our generation. Politically, we are in favor of a regional solution. A part of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) should be annexed by Israel, and the other parts should be incorporated in a confederation with Jordan.&#xA;SPIEGEL: So there should not be a Palestinian state?&#xA;Shaked: We see nation-states collapsing all around us: Libya, Syria, Iraq. We do not want another failed state in our neighborhood, which would rapidly turn into a stronghold for terrorists, as we have seen in Gaza. We do not want tunnels to suburbs of Tel Aviv or missiles pointed at Jerusalem.&#xA;SPIEGEL: The peace process has been stagnating for many years now, very much to the rest of the world's frustration.&#xA;Shaked: We will not commit suicide because of pressure from the international community. A Palestinian state is not possible at the moment. I would rather fight and try to explain the situation in the Middle East to the world than to agree to steps that harm my country to satisfy the international community.&#xA;SPIEGEL: But polls regularly show that a majority of Israelis wants peace talks.&#xA;Shaked: The right wing controls Israel today -- we have the mandate of the people. I think the majority of Israelis understand that there will not be two states existing peacefully, side-by-side, in the near future.&#xA;SPIEGEL: For a few months now, Israel has been haunted by a new wave of violence. Many people fear the attacks will continue or even increase because Palestinians have lost hope in a political solution to the conflict and the economic situation is terrible. So you just want to continue with the same strategy?&#xA;Shaked: We have no other choice but to go on managing the conflict. We propose a stability plan: We want to strengthen the Palestinian Authority economically and establish mutual industrial zones and help them to develop independent energy capabilities, enabling the Palestinians to live their lives independently and have a future. This is where the European States should invest, not in NGOs that harm Israel.&#xA;SPIEGEL: One of the reasons the economy is struggling so badly there is because of the blockade imposed by Israel. Traffic in goods to Gaza is strictly regulated. How is anything supposed to develop there?&#xA;Shaked: I have to interrupt you here. The economy in Gaza is declining because Gaza is controlled by a terror regime.&#xA;SPIEGEL: You seem to have an answer for everything. Is this the reason for your nickname, &quot;the computer&quot;?&#xA;Shaked: I do not take things to the heart. I calculate and I do what needs to be done. If I were to start acting emotionally, it would destroy my work.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

" content="Interview with German Interior Minister on Refugee Crisis&#xA;German Interior Minister on Refugee Crisis: 'We Want Clarity on the Refugee Crisis by Spring'&#xA;Interview Conducted by Ralf Neukirch and René Pfister&#xA;DPA&#xA;Refugees in Berlin: &quot;Everyone learns in a crisis,&quot; says Germany's interior minister of government failures in the crisis.&#xA;In an interview, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière, 62, warns that the government in Berlin only has a few weeks left to solve the refugee problem. He fears that Europe's open-border policies may soon end if a solution isn't found.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Interior Minister de Maizière, the state of Bavaria has written to Chancellor Merkel demanding that she change her refugee policies, there is protest among German conservatives and now the deputy chair of her own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has come up with her own plan to stymie the flow of refugees to Germany. Is it time to concede that the chancellor's Plan A has failed?&#xA;De Maizière: No. Coping with the refugee crisis is complex -- it has an international aspect, a European and a national one. We are addressing all three fields methodically and step by step. It is an illusion to believe that there is a Plan A, B, or C to solve the refugee crisis.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Isn't the real illusion the idea that Europe is going to help bail Germany out of the refugee crisis? Austria has announced a cap on the number of refugees it is willing to take, Denmark has tightened its asylum laws and Sweden is no longer allowing refugees without papers into the country.&#xA;De Maizière: On Monday, I sat together with my European counterparts in Amsterdam and the degree of responsibility they felt was indeed very divergent. However, it is a mistake if some partners believe they can avoid the problem. Should the Schengen system of open borders face additional pressure or its long-term viability continue to be questioned, they will realize that the refugee crisis than just a German issue, because all in Europe would be hurt.&#xA;SPIEGEL: In mid-December, the CDU agreed at its party convention that the number of refugees has to be significantly reduced. How much time do you have left?&#xA;De Maizière: We want clarity by spring. Compared to September and October, when on some days as many as 10,000 people entered Germany, the number has decreased significantly. In January, an average of 2,000 people came per day, which, projected over a year would still be very many -- too many. So no matter what, we need to prevent the influx from massively increasing again in the spring. Time is running out.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Is the drop in the number of refugees in recent weeks solely attributable to bad weather?&#xA;De Maizière: To a large degree, probably yes. Although there have been sporadic efforts by Turkey to stop illegal migration across the Aegean Sea, this is still not happening on the scale that is necessary.&#xA;SPIEGEL: What would happen if Turkey and Europe were to let the German government down? Would Germany then close its borders to refugees?&#xA;De Maizière: I don't take part in speculation over various scenarios. Instead, I work to ensure that our approach will be successful.&#xA;SPIEGEL: At the moment there is discussion over stopping refugees at the border between Slovenia and Croatia.&#xA;De Maizière: This is an idea that is being discussed especially by the southeastern European countries themselves. But you also have to consider the fact this would effectively shut Greece out of the Schengen area and could lead to a backup (of refugees), either in Greece, in Macedonia, where we already observed this effect this week, or elsewhere in the Balkans. You cannot simply ignore that.&#xA;SPIEGEL: What do you mean by that?&#xA;De Maizière: That we have to continue to work on other solutions in parallel. It is a matter of supporting countries, like Lebanon and Jordan, where large refugee camps are located. It is a matter of establishing a link between migration and development aid so that we can encourage the countries of North Africa, especially, to take back illegal migrants again. And we have to intensify our talks with Turkey.&#xA;SPIEGEL: If the situation is truly to be brought under control by March, then Turkey has to close its beaches to refugees and traffickers. Is it even logistically possible for the Turks to control a section of coast that is several hundred kilometers long?&#xA;De Maizière: It could at least be done much better than it is right now.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Turkey is already accommodating more than 2 million refugees. Viewed from that perspective, the government in Ankara is likely pleased when refugees leave the country and head for Europe.&#xA;De Maizière: Turkey and Europe have common interests. Europe is prepared to help with providing shelter for refugees in Turkey. Turkey is demanding relaxed visa requirements from the EU. There is also a connection between the issue of refugees and the battle against the so-called Islamic State. The perpetrators in Istanbul who killed 10 Germans at the beginning of January were registered as refugees according to Turkish investigators. It will surely not contribute to the stabilization of Turkey domestically if it remains a transit country for refugees in the long term.&#xA;SPIEGEL: At the moment, Turkey is constructing a massive border fortification along the Turkish-Syrian border. Is it not hypocritical for Germany to say it wants to help refugees on the one hand, but then, on the other, places pressure on Turkey, with the outcome being that an escape route from the Syrian civil war is blocked?&#xA;De Maizière: The only answer to that is that we need to do everything in our power to put an end to the horrendous conditions in Syria. Furthermore, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with border control. We have a fence on the land border between Turkey and Greece. We have a fence between Turkey and Bulgaria. We have a fence between Morocco and the Spanish exclave Melilla. We rightly expect every country in the Schengen zone to protect its external border. And I am sympathetic to the fact that Turkey is doing everything it can to prevent the civil war in Syria from spilling over into its own country.&#xA;SPIEGEL: But the consequence is that Syrians are no longer able to flee from Assad's barrel bombs.&#xA;De Maizière: That is why it is so important to combat the roots of the flight. I am a politician, but I am also a Christian and, as such, I worry about the situation people in the region are in -- and I am convinced that we in Germany and the international community need and can do considerably more on this issue. However, it is also true that it is impossible for Germany to take in all the refugees from the world's crisis regions. And this especially applies to those people not from Syria who are coming here for a better life or to look for a job in Germany.&#xA;SPIEGEL: In retrospect, was it a mistake that Chancellor Merkel didn't explicitly state at the start of the refugee crisis that Germany does not have unlimited capacity for taking in people?&#xA;De Maizière: We have done that several times. It was just that the people from the crisis areas were already on their way -- and they didn't just leave following the chancellor's decision at the beginning of September to take in refugees who had been stranded in Hungary.&#xA;SPIEGEL: The German government's central message was, &quot;We can handle this&quot; and &quot;there is no upper limit for asylum.&quot; Do you honestly believe that this wasn't a trigger that led people to come to Germany?&#xA;De Maizière: I do not want to be a part of any debates about the causes of the flight or enticement effects . Surely there were several.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Was the idea of a Willkommenskultur, or welcoming culture, for the refugees a mistake?&#xA;De Maizière: Asolutely not. We should be proud when refugees say that the German border official was the first polite police officer they had ever encountered in their life. Of course you could say that even that could be an enticement to come. It has to be self-evident that we seek to provide people with decent accommodations. The personal experiences that are shared using smartphones play a considerable role in the fact that so many people want to come to us.&#xA;SPIEGEL: So you're saying that the German government did everything right?&#xA;De Maizière: Please. Who does everything right? Everyone learns in a crisis. We introduced the nuclear energy phase-out (in Germany) after the accident at Fukushima. During the financial crisis, we began the search quite late for a solution for the entire system rather than rescuing individual banks. And it was relatively late in the euro crisis that we pushed through stringent conditions. All that was correct. In the refugee crisis, we have achieved a whole lot during only five months that would not have been possible without the crisis.&#xA;Goetz Schleser/DER SPIEGEL&#xA;German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière: &quot;We would be doing ourselves all a favor if we were to refocus on finding a solution to the challenges instead of stirring up political passions.&quot;&#xA;SPIEGEL: What have we learned from the refugee crisis?&#xA;De Maizière: We have agreed on (revisions to our asylum laws through) the Asylum I and Asylum II legislative bills, we have declared a number of countries to be safe countries of origin and we have simplified regulations. Until the middle of last year, when we spoke about migration, it had been almost exclusively about migration from the Balkan states. As a result of our measures, that issue has been largely resolved today. And all of that happened within just a few months. I think we have demonstrated that were are very capable of learning.&#xA;SPIEGEL: The Asylum II bill, which limits the right of asylum-seekers to bring family members who have been left behind to Germany and also makes deportations easier for people whose asylum applications are rejected, was delayed for a long time because the conservatives could not reach an agreement with their government coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats. Don't tactical games like this play right into the hands of the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party?&#xA;De Maizière: Things are not that simple, though I would have liked to have seen a quicker agreement. In any case, it was not due to a lack of reasonable proposals from my side.&#xA;SPIEGEL: There are numerous people in the police and security agencies who are urging you to adopt a firmer stance. On the other side, you have Chancellor Merkel, who has struck a markedly different tone. Do get the feeling sometimes that you're trapped in the middle?&#xA;De Maizière: Each government minister views the circumstances of each issue differently. An interior minister has a different view of visa liberalization than does a foreign minister. An education minister has a different take on the supply of teachers than a finance minister. It is my job as interior minister to speak out early and clearly on the issue of security, order and the integration of refugees.&#xA;SPIEGEL: In the past, government ministers have stepped down because they no longer felt they could support their government's policies. Is there a line in the sand for you in terms of Merkel's refugee policies?&#xA;De Maizière: The German chancellor and I have known each other since the fall of 1989, 26 years. We have worked together very closely in a number of different capacities. That is more than the normal relationship a German chancellor has with a cabinet member. Please, you do not need to be worried about that.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Given that it directs attention at the problems, is the mass criticism by Horst Seehofer , the head of Merkel's Bavarian sister party, against her policies actually helpful in a way?&#xA;De Maizière: I can understand it when Horst Seehofer points out the concerns. More recently, however, I would have preferred more confidential talks between partners.&#xA;SPIEGEL: You are referring to the letter the Bavarian state government sent in which it threatened to sue the federal government if it does not implement an upper limit on the number of refugees entering the country and move to secure Germany's borders.&#xA;De Maizière: Too many letters are being sent at the moment between people who see each other frequently in person. It would be better if people discussed things internally and solved problems together. I also believe there is only a limited chance that such a lawsuit would be successful. Of course we are complying with the rules and laws. In addition, if the Federal Constitutional Court were to agree to take on the case, it is certain that it would not issue a ruling quickly. That's another reason why I do not consider Bavaria's action to be a constructive approach.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Are we currently experiencing the most serious crisis yet in Angela Merkel's time as chancellor?&#xA;De Maizière: That is something for the historians to determine at some point. Clearly it is a major challenge. But not just for the chancellor. For everyone.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Let's put the question another way: Is the crisis so major that it could cause Merkel to fall?&#xA;De Maizière: We would be doing ourselves all a favor if we were to refocus on finding a solution to the challenges instead of stirring up political passions.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Has the crisis already changed Germany?&#xA;De Maizière: Yes. At least there is a change at the moment. And it was surely intensified by ( the events ) of New Year's Eve in Cologne. In many places, the optimistic attitude &quot;We Germans are able to solve every problem&quot; has been supplanted by the difficult question: &quot;Are we still capable of solving this?&quot;&#xA;SPIEGEL: And this only happened because we are once again facing a wave of refugees?&#xA;De Maizière: I think there are also other causes. The possible irregularities in the awarding of the World Cup, the Volkswagen scandal, the problems encountered in the construction of the new Berlin airport, Hamburg's failed bid for the Olympics, the high number of refugees, the fear that terrorism is approaching, still persistent worries about the euro -- all those things have put a dent in the confidence of many Germans. This worries me because it has a tendency to make problems bigger and not smaller.&#xA;SPIEGEL: By contrast, it is Germany's self-confidence that has bothered many of our neighbors.&#xA;De Maizière: There is a sort of fatigue in our country when it comes to change, more so in the eastern states than in the western ones. In earlier times, globalization always appeared at first glance to be happening elsewhere, and we were the winners. Now the darker side of globalization has also arrived.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Is that really true? Germany is still faring very well compared to other countries.&#xA;De Maizière: That is true. For generations parents have been telling their children: We work hard so that things will be better for you than they are for us. People can sense that this sentence is no longer as valid. If we work hard, the best case scenario is that our children and grandchildren will have things as good as we have them -- and things really are quite good for us, especially if you look at our history. This causes many people to conclude: Let's pull the blanket over our heads and wait for the storm to pass so that nothing will change and things stay good. I think that's wrong and illusory. We have to address the challenges of a changed world. But with a lot of people, I think this fundamental sense of resignation explains a lot.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Minister de Maizière, we thank you for this interview.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

But so far only one exists on the island of Lesbos -- and it's not making much of a dent." content="Problems with Migrant Registration Centers in Greece&#xA;Greek Registration Centers: Why Refugee 'Hotspots' Aren't Working&#xA;By Giorgos Christides in Mytilene, Greece&#xA;AP/dpa&#xA;Refugees travel by boat from Turkey to Lesbos. Despite the attention to the crisis around the world, people continue to drown in the Aegean Sea.&#xA;The construction of registration centers for migrants in Greece was meant to stem the tide of people into Europe. But so far only one exists on the island of Lesbos -- and it's not making much of a dent.&#xA;A few kilometres south of Mytilene, the capital of the Greek island of Lesbos, an elderly man stands close to a cliff. His eyes are fixed on the eight-mile, watery stretch separating the city's outskirts from the Turkish coast. He's looking for the next dinghy with refugees and migrants that will brave the perilous crossing in an attempt to land on the stony beach below.&#xA;The man, Manolis, has been at this spot since noon. By 4 p.m., he has helped migrants disembark from six flimsy boats. &quot;No one was in any danger, thank God. This was a good day, with calm seas and high temperatures,&quot; he says with relief. The previous day, a five-year-old child and two women died from hypothermia after crossing to Lesbos in freezing weather.&#xA;Manolis, a local, spends hours here every day. &quot;I couldn't just watch the tragedy unfold in the news,&quot; he says. He wishes Europe's politicians would react similarly. A year into the refugee crisis, Europe's response has involved a combination of unrealistic targets, foot-dragging, shortsighted self-interest and bureaucratic insanity. Last year, 3,771 people lost their lives crossing the Mediterranean.&#xA;Giorgos Christides&#xA;Manolis observes the sea from the beach on Lesbos. &quot;I couldn't just watch the tragedy unfold in the news,&quot; he says.&#xA;European officials are now emphasizing the importance of registration centers on Greek islands. In theory, these so-called &quot; hotspots &quot; would help slow the flow of migrants heading to the north and mitigate security risks by swiftly identifying, registering and fingerprinting all arrivals. Migrants ineligible for protection would be deported and the rest distributed across Europe.&#xA;There are two main problems with the hotspots concept. First, only one of the five planned hotspots in Greece actually exists and is sufficiently operational. It is located close to the village of Moria, 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Mytilene.&#xA;So far, the planned hotpots on the other four Greek islands have been hampered by opposition from local residents and mayors, red tape and a lack of funding and resources. In Kos, for example, the government and the island's mayor disagree about the location and mission of the hotspot. The mayor wants refugees to remain a maximum of 24 hours, fearing a more prolonged and prominent presence will be bad for tourism.&#xA;Migrant Flow Still One-Sided&#xA;As for the flow of people northwards, nothing has changed. The migrants keep coming. On Wednesday of last week, despite snow and freezing temperatures, more than 2,000 people made the crossing to Lesbos. According to a report in the Greek state news agency, smugglers had cut prices by half that day, to 500. As for deportations, in the first two weeks of January Greece sent back 130 people to Turkey while some 30,000 came from the opposite direction.&#xA;The relocation scheme is not faring much better. Hotspots are supposed to be closely linked to a much advertised EU plan that envisages the distribution of a total of 66,400 asylum seekers from Greece to other EU member-states.&#xA;But that target number is laughable given the scale of the crisis (in 2015, more than 850,000 people arrived in Greece). Still, even by those low standards, the results are disappointing. A representative from the Asylum Authority in Athens told SPIEGEL ONLINE that the grand total of relocations of asylum-seekers from Greece by Jan. 25 would be 157.&#xA;Refugees are duly informed by officials in Moria that they can apply for the relocation scheme, but very few choose to do so. The vast majority take their temporary permits, board the next ferry to Athens and then head north to the Greek border with Macedonia. From there, if they manage to cross the border, their destination is usually Germany.&#xA;But even if more migrants were to choose Greece as their temporary home, where are they supposed to stay? Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has correctly shut down inhumane migrant detention centers. Greece was supposed to build hospitality centers instead, with a capacity of 20,000 people, on the mainland. So far, though, they are nowhere to be seen. &quot;All we have is speculation. Nothing concrete about the centers,&quot; says an official at Greece's Immigration Ministry.&#xA;DPA&#xA;A so-called hotspot in Moria: Refugees are seen here waiting to make the trip north to Germany.&#xA;The rent subsidy program has been just as hobbled. It was supposed to offer subsidies to 20,000 refugees to allow them to stay in proper homes in Greece. Tsipras had even said this would give a welcome boost to the depressed real estate market. But so far nothing has happened. SPIEGEL ONLINE was told that the Athens office of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is currently evaluating the proposals of NGOs who have applied to run the program.&#xA;Greek Lethargy&#xA;Many in Europe point the finger at Greece, arguing that the Tsipras government is intentionally dragging its feet, letting migrants continue their journey north to protect tourism and avoid the kind of political fallout now being faced by Angela Merkel.&#xA;The government rejects this criticism. There is genuine fear in Athens that a lack of progress will be an excuse by EU countries to raise more walls, close more borders. Greece could go from being a transit country to being a bottleneck, a &quot;warehouse,&quot; as Tsipras has warned.&#xA;But even Greek officials claim that Greek bureaucracy is one reason for the slow progress. Greece can actually cut red tape in a minute -- when it wants to.&#xA;That's what Athens did ahead of the 2004 Olympics, which were well-staged -- at an astronomical cost -- through a combination of strong political will, popular support and a litany of special legislation and expedited processes. Parliamentary decorum and due process weren't big obstacles when parliamentarians had to vote to secure bailout loans in the dead of the night. Unfortunately, the humanitarian tragedy doesn't seem to merit the same kind of relentless efficiency.&#xA;Whatever its failings, though, Greece is an easy and convenient target. A country with few resources, battling recession and social strife, is being asked to handle a humanitarian crisis of gigantic proportions with little help from its friends. Greek officials often slam Europe for delays in sending more men, money and resources. They are also outraged both by Turkey for failing to clamp down on smuggling networks and by some of Greece's wealthier partners like Austria, who, safe in their geographical distance, decide to cap admissions and tighten border controls.&#xA;The way things stand, and as Greece braces for a spike in migrant arrivals in the spring, one thing is certain: There will be more deaths in the Aegean.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

I knew right away that it was a bomb attack. You know, this used to happen every day before, in the 1970s. I know the sound of a bomb exploding.&quot;&#xA;It is Thursday, January 14. Two days ago, 11 people died in the attack near the Blue Mosque. The apartment of Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, is in the Cihangir district, only a few kilometers from the site of the attack.&#xA;The view from Pamuk's window is almost as famous as the author himself. In fact, one of his books is titled &quot;The View From My Window.&quot; Still, it catches the visitor by surprise, because it's such an unexpected view, a shockingly vast panorama under a giant blue winter sky. It is as if his desk were poised in the air.&#xA;The view overlooks the Bosphorus, with Asia on the left and Europe on the right, ships in the middle, a mosque directly in front of the balcony. It is accompanied by the sounds of meowing cats and screeching gulls and the sensation of cold winter air. The view seems stereotypically fitting for a man who has repeatedly been described as a builder of bridges between East and West, between Asia and Europe. But he hates being called a bridge builder, because he merely tries to write good novels -- novels that are deeply rooted in Turkish and Ottoman culture, but are also marked by Pamuk's love of Western life and literature.&#xA;Even before our conversation begins, he suggests the sequence of topics. &quot;Please start with politics,&quot; he says. &quot;Then we'll have that behind us and will be free for our discussion about literature.&quot; He pulls out a notebook, from which he will later read a few sentences like proclamations.&#xA;But now, to begin the conversation, he talks about the bomb. And about how he, after hearing the explosion and realizing what must have happened, waited 10 minutes before sitting down at his computer to see his fears confirmed. Then, another 20 minutes later, he began receiving emails from newspapers around the world, in countries like Italy, Germany and the United States, asking him to issue a statement. There were no emails from Turkey .&#xA;&quot;Bombs are a normal occurrence for us,&quot; he says. But even if it isn't normal for him, what should he write from his desk here in Istanbul? That he rejects terror? That the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS) is a gruesome organization? &quot;You want something about IS?&quot; he asks. &quot;Okay, it's a gruesome, primitive, inhuman organization. But do you know what? The media report on IS far too much. This fuels hysteria and panic, which is part of the problem. They are so pleased about the panic they are spreading. In my opinion, the reporting lacks analysis and clever thoughts. All of this helps IS.&quot; And, he adds: &quot;This is a message I wish to deliver.&quot;&#xA;Pamuk talks about the &quot;crippled Turkish democracy,&quot; and about the fact that there is no freedom of expression in Turkey. He talks about an imprisoned journalist friend, and about how the government exerts pressure on newspaper editors and on all critical journalists. He complains that there is no separation of powers in Turkey today and says, with a laugh: &quot;The doctrines of Montesquieu are not popular here.&quot; Only then does he point out, seriously: &quot;I have the Nobel Prize, so I can say what I please.&quot; But his country is in such bad shape, he explains, &quot;and I don't want to comment on everything every day.&quot;&#xA;His Most Successful Book in Turkey&#xA;Pamuk is a courageous man and a great writer. A little over 10 years ago, he was charged with &quot;insulting Turkishness&quot; after referring to the Armenian genocide in an interview. He was on the death list of extreme nationalists, as was his Armenian-Turkish friend Hrant Dink, who was shot to death in Istanbul in 2007. For a time, Pamuk was protected by three bodyguards provided by the Turkish government. These days he has only one, whom he can call when he wants to go out. &quot;There isn't as much hatred against me at the moment,&quot; he says, &quot;not as much political pressure as there was 10 years ago.&quot; His most recently published book, &quot;A Strangeness in my Mind,&quot; has been his most successful in Turkey. (It will be published in German in a few days).&#xA;It's the story of Mevlut, a young man who comes to Istanbul from his village in Anatolia in the late 1960s and begins working as a street vendor, which he ends up doing for the rest of his life. He sells Boza, a beverage made from millet that contains so little alcohol that it was allowed during the period when alcohol was banned -- a trick beverage to circumvent strict religious rules, an alcoholic beverage for people who don't drink alcohol.&#xA;Mevlut is a poor boy when he arrives in Istanbul, and unlike most of the people who came with him, he will remain poor. He is a naïve, optimistic protagonist with the gift of recognizing happiness and holding onto it when it is there. At his cousin's wedding, he falls in love with a young girl. He writes her letters for many years, and finally kidnaps her to spend his life with her. But he has been deceived. He kidnapped the wrong woman, the older sister of his beloved. His devious cousin had given him the wrong name from the beginning and sent his letters to the wrong woman. But now that he has kidnapped the sister, giving her back is not an option.&#xA;Mevlut is a pragmatist of happiness. He shows her his humble house, and she falls asleep immediately. &quot;Mevlut went up to her quietly. For a long time, he looked at Rayiha lying on the bed, knowing that he would never forget this moment.&quot; It was because &quot;he wasn't alone in the world.&quot; Besides, &quot;she had even appreciated his letters.&quot;&#xA;Pamuk talks about the love story as he stands at the large window in his apartment. I say that it's completely clear why the couple are happy together, because it's the love story of a poet. Mevlut created this woman and this love with his letters and his words. The wrong woman becomes the right woman through the power of his words. &quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; says Pamuk, and laughs. &quot;I think it's more about sex. They do it with each other for the first time. They're happy. He is a grateful, unassuming person. That's all.&quot;&#xA;For 44 years and 575 pages, we accompany Mevlut on his routes as a street vendor. During this period, Istanbul grows by 10 million people. The old city dies and a new one arises, new neighborhoods are built, and there are so many opportunities to become a self-made man. The opportunities are there for Mevlut, too, but he doesn't take them.&#xA;It is the first time Pamuk, who comes from a wealthy family, has written about a man from the lower class, &quot;an everyman,&quot; as he puts it. Perhaps this is part of the reason the book has struck a chord with Turkish readers: Mevlut is one of them. And Pamuk doesn't look down on him, describes him with love and humanity. He is an apolitical protagonist. He is constantly drawn into political conversations as he sells his beverages, but refuses to allow himself to be pulled in any direction. He is a Turkish version of Hans Castorp, the protagonist of Thomas Mann's &quot;Magic Mountain.&quot; He believes that everything is worth listening to. &quot;As a Boza vendor, you cannot have any political opinions,&quot; says Pamuk, because it would scare away potential customers.&#xA;Nevertheless, &quot;A Strangeness in My Mind&quot; is also a political novel -- it describes corruption, political battles, the war against the Kurds, gentrification, and the victims of destruction and reconstruction.&#xA;'It Was Supposed to be a Short Novel'&#xA;Pamuk worked on the book for six years, longer than on any other book before it. He did a lot of research, and he also had others do a lot of research for him. Assistants, friends and students he knows helped him, conducting conversations and interviews for him. A small group of six students met in his apartment once a month. They ate and drank wine and discussed issues like urban development, city planning and gentrification.&#xA;&quot;Young people who opened new horizons for me, and who explored new topics. But I did most of the interviews myself, with all kinds of different people. Many were reserved and suspicious, while others were excited to be able to tell me their stories. They would call me and say: 'You know, I also have a cousin, and you really have to meet him! You wouldn't believe what he has to say.' Now I have enough material for a few more books. This was supposed to be short novel at first, but there was simply too much to tell. It was like 'Ulysses,' which Joyce had also planned as a short story.&quot;&#xA;It's fun to watch Pamuk build momentum as he talks about writing, about the book's English title and the fact that when he was in school, his classmates were already talking about his peculiar way of talking and thinking. In our conversation, Pamuk repeats in English what his schoolmates used to say: &quot;You have a strange mind, Orhan.&quot; And when he discovered the phrase &quot;a strangeness in the mind&quot; in William Wordsworth's &quot;The Prelude&quot; a few years ago, he knew that he would use it as the title of a book one day.&#xA;The book is about a stranger's view of a familiar world. Mevlut enters Istanbul, a city that is constantly and rapidly changing. He never enters the same city as the same person. At the very end of the novel, Pamuk writes: &quot;He came to understand a truth that a part of him had known all along: walking around the city at night made him feel as though he were wandering around his own head. That was why whenever he spoke to the walls, advertisements, shadows, and strange and mysterious shapes he couldn't see in the night, he always felt as if he were speaking with himself.&quot;&#xA;Later in our conversation, we step out onto Pamuk's balcony. The high-rise buildings on the Asian side are glowing in the reddish light of the setting sun. &quot;You wouldn't believe how many poems there are about that light, about this view, so many poems,&quot; he says. The trick, he says, is to see things in new ways, as exotic and different. The same thing applies to his city, the city he has written about often and in most of his books, about its new buildings, its growth and destruction. Pamuk studied architecture, he says, which has helped him a great deal. At the beginning of each book, he says, he has a plan. &quot;Only the last chapter,&quot; he says, making a whooshing sound and waving his arm in the air, is created &quot;in a sweep of creativity, when nothing is planned anymore.&quot;&#xA;We go back inside, and he pulls out an old bell once used by a Boza vendor to attract customers. In the novel, the sound of the bell ends up being the sound of melancholy. In the end, Mevlut's only remaining customers are the ones who remember the old Istanbul at the sound of his bell.&#xA;Pamuk shows me his desk, and I ask whether the phone on the desk is the one with which he received the memorable call from the Nobel committee in 2006. &quot;Oh no, that was in America,&quot; he says. Then we take the narrow elevator two floors up, where he owns another apartment with equally breathtaking views. At the moment, only books inhabit the apartment. They are packed into countless boxes, and empty shelves wait for their future residents. He searches for the German section and quickly finds a large box of books by Thomas Mann: &quot;Royal Highness,&quot; and a 40-year-old edition of &quot;Buddenbrooks.&quot; He has often said that he comes from a Buddenbrook family.&#xA;His grandfather was an energetic factory owner, his father was a wistful but unsuccessful poet, and then there was him, Hanno-Orhan, who transformed himself into a Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate. When he was reading Mann for the first time, did he think of the parallels to his own life? &quot;Oh, of course I did,&quot; he says, pulling a volume by Max Frisch from the first box, followed by a book by Hans Magnus Enzensberger.&#xA;On the second-to-the-last page of his novel, Pamuk writes the following about his naïve protagonist: &quot;These people's happiness pleased Mevlut. Human beings were made to be happy, honest, and open.&quot; Pamuk, surrounded by boxes of books, says: &quot;I'm not a happy person. It isn't my nature. But I also don't believe that we are in this world to be happy. Oh, I'm a happy writer, but I'm certain that I will never be a happy person.&quot;&#xA;Advertisement&#xA;"/>

The issue has become central to the country's heated refugee debate. &lt;i>By SPIEGEL Staff&lt;/i>&#xA;" content="Sexism and Islam Debated in Germany after Cologne Attacks&#xA;Sexism and Islam: 'Where I'm From, This is Handled By Men'&#xA;AP&#xA;The New Year's Eve attacks on women in Cologne have led to a new discussion within Germany about the treatment of women in Islamic societies. The issue has become central to the country's heated refugee debate. By SPIEGEL Staff&#xA;The Erich Gutenberg College is a trade school in Mülheim, an economically underdeveloped district in Cologne. Two-thirds of the students here are first- or second-generation immigrants, and most are Muslim. A few days after the incidents in Cologne on New Year's Eve, in which a large crowd of men with supposed immigrant backgrounds harassed and sexually assaulted women in the city's main train station, a female teacher stood in front of her class at the school and tried to talk to her students about that night's events.&#xA;She was horrified by their reaction. &quot;What exactly do you want?&quot; one of the students shouted. &quot;That's what women can expect if they walk around there at night!&quot; No one in the classroom protested. The girls were silent. &quot;They have their thoughts on the issue, but they often say nothing,&quot; says the school's principal, Rolf Wohlgemuth. After the incident, he went into the teacher's classroom and tried to explain to the students that the government protects the rights of everyone, including women. He is skeptical that the message will have a lasting impact on all the students.&#xA;Three weeks have passed since New Year's Eve in Cologne. About 800 women have filed complaints with the police since then, and the shockwaves from Cologne are still affecting politicians in Berlin. The police are still searching for more suspects, even as the country remains mystified by their motives. Cologne could go down in history as a turning point in Germany's refugee debate, but there is also another, more fundamental dimension. Even though the Cologne perpetrators constitute only a tiny, criminal minority within the migrant and refugee population, the most important aspect of the attacks is that their victims were women, bringing women's rights to the forefront of the integration debate.&#xA;The attacks sparked a major debate in Germany and raised important questions about gender roles in society. Critics have noted that many Muslim societies have patriarchal inclinations that define gender roles between men and women far more narrowly than in the West. Did the attacks in Cologne cast light on tensions between these patriarchal tendencies and Western notions of society and equal rights for women? The Economist tackled the issue in mid-January its article &quot; Migrant Men and European Women.&quot; In an interview with SPIEGEL, leading German thinker, writer and Islam scholar Navid Kermani posed the question of whether Germany will succeed in its integration challenge. Meanwhile, the left-leaning weekly newspaper Die Zeit asked: &quot;Who Is the Arab Man?&quot;&#xA;It's a question that many women in Germany are asking themselves in the wake of Cologne. There is myriad anecdotal evidence of German women experiencing the culture clash firsthand. There are reports of men who refuse to shake hands with women. Some female teachers have to deal with fathers of students who refuse to speak to them, or parents who don't want a woman teaching their child. And there are instances in the business world where men refuse to work with women and demand that a woman's male superior be appointed as their point of contact in dealings. &quot;This macho culture can already be found in Germany,&quot; says Ahmad Mansour, a Palestinian-Israeli who works as a psychologist focused on integration issues.&#xA;New Debates about Islam&#xA;Representatives of official Muslim religious organizations claim that discrimination and violence against women have nothing to do with Islam. &quot;Islam assumes that woman and man are equal before God and the law,&quot; says Aiman Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. It is true that Islam and patriarchy are not inevitably intertwined, and because Islam has no supreme leader like the pope who can establish a binding interpretation, the religion permits a liberal interpretation of the Koran. In reality, however, the global Muslim mainstream has very different notions of equality than the West, and the Koran is often used to justify patriarchal and misogynistic convictions.&#xA;In predominantly Muslim regions, the state of women's rights is especially troubling. Polling indicates that the majority of Muslims do not take it for granted that men and women have the same rights. The Pew Research Center in Washington surveyed 38,000 Muslims between 2008 and 2012. More than half -- and a whopping 87 percent in the Middle East and North Africa -- held the view that a woman should always obey her husband. In fact, only a quarter of those questioned in the Middle East and North Africa felt that daughters and sons should inherit equal shares of their parents' money, and only a third said that women have the right to get divorced.&#xA;Lamya Kaddor is tired of the debate over Islam. The liberal Islamic scholar has been working as a mediator for years. She explains Islam to non-Muslims in Germany, and she explains non-believers to Muslims. There has been much to explain since Sept. 11, 2001, when al-Qaida terrorists flew airliners into the World Trade Center in the name of Allah. The discussion about terrorism was followed by a series of debates, on forced marriages and honor killings, female genital mutilation, Salafists, the construction of mosques and now, once again, the image of women. &quot;Now I'm starting to explain what Islam is all over again,&quot; says Kaddor.&#xA;The 37-year-old teaches Islamic Studies in Dinslaken, in northwestern Germany. The image of women held by many migrants is indeed a problem, she says. They have come to a free country from &quot;oppressed societies,&quot; she says. &quot;Then they have to wait 15 months to find out whether or not they can stay. This is too long. It allows people to fall back into old patterns,&quot; says Kaddor.&#xA;'Where I'm From, This is Handled By Men'&#xA;Many women come into contact with these patterns in Germany, not just in the form of sexual harassment, but in situations where it becomes clear that they are not being accepted in their professions and social roles. Most of the women SPIEGEL spoke with about the subject were unwilling to be quoted by name, fearing that they could be labeled as xenophobic, and they stress that difficulties are the exception, and that most Muslim men essentially have no problem with women.&#xA;&quot;Muslim offenders often have a problem accepting female judges,&quot; says one judge from Hamburg. She claims they treat her with contempt, and use gestures or facial expressions to show that they do not respect a woman in her position. A female flight attendant says she &quot;often has problems with Muslim men working as ground personnel.&quot; To avoid unpleasant situations, she says, crews often decide to send a male coworker instead.&#xA;Female German Federal Police officers who process immigrants at the border with Austria say that men ignore or berate them. Some spit on the ground in front of them, says one officer. &quot;That sometimes requires a more robust effort.&quot;&#xA;The personnel manager for a company in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg remembers how a male employee snapped at her, saying that she, as a &quot;German woman,&quot; had no business telling him what to do. On another occasion, an employee asked to meet with a male colleague instead of her. &quot;I have nothing against you,&quot; he said, &quot;but where I'm from, this is handled by men.&quot;&#xA;Maresi Lassek, president of an elementary school in the northern city of Bremen for 20 years, remembers &quot;how fathers kept their hands clasped behind their backs&quot; to avoid having to shake her hand. An elementary school teacher from the Odenwald region south of Frankfurt speaks of &quot;outlandish experiences,&quot; and says: &quot;I often had the feeling that fathers didn't take me seriously, because I'm a woman.&quot; A teacher from Hamburg says that fathers tried &quot;to avoid us women and converse with our male colleagues instead.&quot; And when Annelie Hobohm, who teaches illiterate children in a Hamburg school, asks everyone in the class to clean up, the boys sometimes refuse to sweep the floor. Cleaning is women's work, they say.&#xA;Sineb El Masrar was born in Hanover in 1981, the daughter of Moroccan immigrants. She's also a member of the German Islam Conference and a pioneer in the Islamic women's movement. Her book &quot;Emancipation in Islam -- a Reckoning with Its Enemies,&quot; is set to be published in Germany next month. &quot;There is a misogyny, a hatred for women,&quot; she says.&#xA;A Dichotomy in Images of Women&#xA;El Masrar says that the history of Islam, up until the present, has been shaped by the patriarchal oppression of women. She argues that the Cologne assaults were spurred by a number of things: crowded living conditions for migrants in hostels or small apartments, their lack of prospects and the neglect they experience when they lack the support and supervision of the family.&#xA;But there is also another reason, says El Masrar: &quot;A culture that makes all things sexual taboo.&quot; The men came from an environment in which there is no tender sexuality, she explains. &quot;Everything that's connected with tenderness and sex is placed in the context of prostitution.&quot;&#xA;She speaks of a schematic image in which women are either saints or whores, in which there is no room for self-determined women. For some Muslim men, says El Masrar, it is irritating and frustrating that not every woman in Germany is available, &quot;just because she's walking in a miniskirt.&quot; Some, she explains &quot;react by becoming extremely religious, while others become aggressive.&quot;&#xA;El Masrar points to Moroccan men as an example, noting that many experience frustration not only in Europe, but also in the country of their origin. &quot;Sex is taboo, on the one hand,&quot; she says, &quot;but on the other it's downloadable everywhere.&quot; There are even sex hotlines in Arabic, she says. The men act out their insecurities on the street, where women are harassed and propositioned. But women in the country have been fighting back for some time. In a movement similar to #Aufschrei (#Outcry), a German Twitter initiative to raise awareness about sexism and sexual harassment, women in Morocco have taken to the streets to protest &quot;against all that ass and breast grabbing, the whispers and the perversions that women face.&quot;&#xA;Young men are also beginning to seek alternatives to narrow patriarchal role models. Asmen Ilhan is a case in point. A few years ago, the young man from Berlin caught himself pigeonholing the girls in his class into either &quot;sluts&quot; or &quot;non-sluts,&quot; into girls who had a boyfriend, went out at night or wore tight pants, and girls who behaved in a way deemed appropriate by the Turkish community.&#xA;At the Carl-von-Ossietzsky High School in Berlin's Kreuzberg neighborhood, the question of which girls were considered &quot;sluts,&quot; and which ones were not, was an important one -- both for the boys who kept a close eye on their sisters, even though they themselves were making out and having sex with girls, and for the girls, who were better off staying away from men altogether. No one would have been shocked to hear someone yell in the schoolyard: &quot;I'll kill my sister if anyone touches her.&quot; And it would have been hard to tell whether statements like that were meant seriously.&#xA;Program to Change Minds&#xA;Ilhan was always caught in the middle. His parents came to Germany from Turkey in the late 1970s, and he was born in Berlin. To Germans, he was a Turk, and to Turks he was a Kurd. He was never accepted as a traditional Muslim because his father is an Alawite. His mother is involved in the women's movement within the immigrant community: a word like &quot;slut&quot; would never have been allowed at their dinner table.&#xA;But different rules applied in the classroom. Girls were expected to be pure and quiet and boys strong and loud, the latter fixated on their predetermined role as guardians and future breadwinners. Ilhan had already gotten used to this division, if only to fit in, but when he was 16, he began having doubts.&#xA;At the time, a friend invited him to join a group that met regularly to question their concept of how girls and boys should behave. The group members were at odds with a culture in which the honor of an entire family depended on whether a daughter was still a virgin at her wedding, and in which boys were obligated to defend that honor -- whether they liked it or not.&#xA;Ilhan and his friends became part of a project, called Heroes, in which young men from immigrant families campaign for women's rights. It has already trained 35 young men. Those who become &quot;Heroes&quot; are given a certificate to hang in their rooms. The program includes various role-playing games: In one, a strict father sends his son to bring home his sister, who is hanging out with friends, in another, a family forbids a son from marrying his Swedish girlfriend. The boys also play the role of the girl.&#xA;Heroes has held more than 1,000 of these role-playing workshops in schools and youth centers in the last seven years. Even the German president has visited the award-winning project. A photo taken on the day of the president's visit hangs on the wall, across from a poster with a quote from Albert Camus: &quot;Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear.&quot;&#xA;A Bizarre Understanding of Honor?&#xA;&quot;Cologne brought our issues to the fore,&quot; says theater teacher Yilmaz Atmaca, one of the co-founders of the Heroes project. Ilhan, now 23, studies psychology and works as a group leader. Seven boys from the program got together in the first week of January to try to come up with an explanation for the Cologne sexual assaults. In their view, the assaults reflect a bizarre understanding of honor. &quot;I'm afraid that the perpetrators felt that women who were wearing Western clothes and were out alone at night had no honor. This is precisely the attitude we want to prevent with our work.&quot; At the same time, the young men also felt attacked. They have been campaigning for women's rights for years, &quot;and now people are suddenly saying across the board that the Arab man is a threat.&quot;&#xA;Muslim men are not the only ones who feel unsettled since Cologne. Many people in Germany are concerned about the tension between the desire to stand up for women's rights and the desire to show solidarity for refugees. Is it acceptable to lower our standards on emancipation in deference to foreign customs? The Federal Employment Agency is also grappling with this question. It trains its employees in both &quot;intercultural sensitization&quot; and &quot;gender sensitivity.&quot; The problem is that &quot;intercultural competency&quot; and &quot;gender competency&quot; are not always compatible. What happens, for example, when a Muslim customer refuses to shake a female coworker's hand? Should the woman accept this as being correct from an intercultural perspective, or should she take the standpoint of gender sensitivity and insist on a handshake? &quot;There can be contradictions between a consultation that focuses on sensitivity to migrants and one that emphasizes gender sensitivity,&quot; says Eva Peters, director of a project that provides advanced training advice.&#xA;For Julia Klöckner, opposition leader for the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the decision was clear. About four months ago, she chose not to meet with an imam who refused to shake her hand. It was a bold move, but one that raises a necessary question about the limits of tolerance. She was making the point that women cannot be expected to accept discrimination out of consideration for cultural differences.&#xA;This meeting of these cultures is, obviously, not always problematic. A 41-year-old management expert who volunteers to teach German at a refugee hostel in Essen, for instance, has nothing but good things to say about her students. They include construction workers and auto mechanics from Afghanistan, as well as pharmacists from Syria. Her students are always helpful, polite and respectful, she says. &quot;Every time we meet, they are friendly when they greet me and say goodbye, they thank me after the lesson, and they offer to carry my bags when they are heavy. And they also respect my privacy. No one has ever called me at an inappropriate time.&quot;&#xA;On a Saturday in the Advent season, in the lead up to Christmas, the group organized a cooking evening. Men and women chopped vegetables together, stirred the pots and seasoned the food, and finally served up Syrian appetizers and an Afghan rice dish -- united in the proud recognition that their backgrounds and cultures were being honored in this way. As the volunteer teacher put it: &quot;These Muslim men are more appreciative than many Germans I know.&quot;&#xA;By Christiane Hoffmann, Julia Jüttner, Sarah Kempf, Ann-Kathrin Müller, Cornelia Schmergal, Katja Thimm, Andreas Ulrich&#xA;Translated from the German by Christopher Sultan&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

Now, though, a protest movement is forming, made up of leftist activists, journalists and even a former prime minister.&#xA;On a cold, damp Saturday afternoon in January, Christmas decorations were still hanging above Nowy Swiat, a main boulevard in Warsaw. The street was empty, but a large crowd had gathered on Warsaw Uprising Square, where the state-owned television station has its headquarters. Several thousand demonstrators were waving the red-and-white Polish flag and chanting their slogan: &quot;Freedom of the Word.&quot; They feared that since the Law and Justice Party (PiS) has come to power and enacted a new law enabling the government to replace managers of public media organizations, freedom of expression is being cut back.&#xA;Kamil Dabrowa, one of the demonstrators, certainly felt that way. A day earlier, he had still been head of First Polish Radio. Then he was fired. Joanna Erbel, a sociologist with dyed red hair, was also demonstrating. Erbel, who received an award for her involvement in a neighborhood initiative, said: &quot;Democracy is at stake in Poland.&quot;&#xA;Mateusz Kijowski was attending a simultaneous demonstration in Lodz. With two earrings in his left ear, a full beard and long gray hair tied together with a rubber band, Kijowski is the leader of a new, non-parliamentary opposition movement, which he founded late last year: the Committee for the Defense of Democracy, or KOD. &quot;The freedom of the press is in jeopardy,&quot; he said, &quot;and with it, democracy as a whole.&quot; Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, the former conservative premier, stayed at home that day, but he usually attends the anti-government demonstrations too.&#xA;In total, about 20,000 people simultaneously protested in Warsaw, Lodz, Berlin, London and Prague that Saturday, marking the third major protest campaign since the national conservatives came into power. The protesters included gay and lesbian activists, environmentalists and veterans of the anti-communist movement that existed before the fall of the Berlin Wall, as well as Catholic conservatives and ordinary citizens. They are united by the same fear: that the national conservatives will transform the country to suit their agenda and will curtail freedom in the process.&#xA;Immediately after its election victory in late October, the government began its &quot;national revolution,&quot; using Hungary as a role model. Its goal is to orient the government, the media, the judiciary, education, government-owned businesses and even theaters and museums toward a single center of power. And this power center is essentially one person: PiS leader and founder Jaroslaw Kaczynski, officially represented by President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Beata Szydlo.&#xA;But Poland is not Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski now faces opposition from a protest movement which seems to be gathering more and more supporters by the week. Unlike the Hungarians, Poles are accustomed to success. Their economy has been growing steadily for the last 25 years, creating a self-confident, affluent, pro-European middle class which is now taking to the streets to defend its freedom against Kaczynski.&#xA;'Poles of the Worst Sort'&#xA;Officials close to Kaczynski say that he fears protests in his own country even more than objections from the European Union and the European Commission's probe into whether Poland's policy changes stand in violation of EU law. Brussels will take a long time to complete its investigation, and most Poles consider it highly unlikely the EU will actually impose sanctions. But large demonstrations are a problem for Kaczynski, who claims that he is fulfilling a national mission and that he represents the interests of all Poles. This is why Kaczynski is currently as disdainful of the EU as he is of the opposition, whose members he berates as &quot;national traitors&quot; and &quot;Poles of the worst sort.&quot;&#xA;He is mainly referring to people like KOD founder Mateusz Kijowski. It was a girlfriend who encouraged him to do something after Kaczynski deprived the country's court of its powers in December and Kijowski answered the call by establishing Facebook group under the name of his committee. &quot;It was a Thursday. We had 100 followers by that evening, 300 the next day and 32,000 by the following Monday.&quot; Today the KOD has more than 133,000 supporters, of which 20,000 are active, Kijowski estimates.&#xA;He hasn't slept much since then. His house in a Warsaw suburb, with its overgrown garden, has become the center of the movement and activists are perched on the sofas with their laptops, answering emails from around the country. Some have been sleeping at Kijowski's chaotic house for several days now. Kijowski, wearing red jeans and a KOD button on his wrinkled jacket, meets with journalists in the kitchen. It could use a good cleaning, but no one has time for that now.&#xA;Kijowski, born in 1968, was involved in the opposition movement against Poland's former communist government. After the fall of communism, he studied computer science and became a consultant to companies and state-owned insurance groups. &quot;After 1989, people of my generation were only interested in themselves for a long time. We were successful and we became affluent. We believed that democracy was guaranteed, but now it's becoming clear that it isn't.&quot;&#xA;It's not entirely accidental that the abbreviation KOD resembles that of a legendary dissident organization from the 1970s. KOR, the &quot;Workers' Defense Committee,&quot; was established to protect workers who had been arrested. &quot;We wanted to initiate a thought process at the time. What should Poland look like in the future?&quot; asks Kijowski. &quot;We don't see ourselves as an anti-PiS organization.&quot;&#xA;Rejecting the West&#xA;But unlike KOR, KOD is mainly a movement of older people. At 31, Joanna Erbel is one of the group's youngest activists. She lives in Mokotów, a former working class neighborhood that is attracting many young Poles, partly as a result of Erbel's efforts. She has been involved in the local self-administration for years and campaigns on behalf of streetcars and bike lanes. She fights to preserve old buildings and traditional milk bars, which serve inexpensive borscht and pierogi.&#xA;She has just baked a spice cake, or an anti-PiS cake, as she calls it -- vegan and dairy-free. The cake is a direct response to a recent comment by the foreign minister, who said that vegetarians and bicyclists are not real Poles. The national conservatives also believe that promiscuity and the &quot;mixing of cultures and races&quot; are ruining Poland.&#xA;&quot;A decent Pole eats cutlets and pickled pork, drives a car and marries young. That's what the PiS wants the whole country to be like,&quot; says Erbel. &quot;The health-conscious, globalized middle class on bikes -- that's the bogeyman.&quot; In other words, people like Erbel, who emcees a male strip cabaret in her free time and is engaged to a Protestant pastor, who also has a male partner and helps organize annual gay pride parades.&#xA;The conservatives reject anything that smells like the West, says Erbel. &quot;In doing so, they are capitalizing on the dissatisfaction of all those who feel that they have not benefited sufficiently from the post-Communist era.&quot; Those include not just blue-collar workers and the elderly, but young people too. In fact, the PiS owes its election victory to younger voters. The party's social promises hit home both in eastern Poland and among many Poles born after 1989.&#xA;In the post-communist era, Kijowski and Erbel's generation benefited from the replacement of the old elites that ran government agencies and companies. But it is difficult for younger people to move up the social ladder today. Many positions are filled and will remain so for a long time, forcing young people to take poorly paid and short-term jobs. Campaigning for bike lanes, as Joanna Erbel has done, is pure decadence for those who cannot even dream of affording a car.&#xA;'Confess? To What?'&#xA;Journalist Kamil Dabrowa is familiar with the feeling of uncertainty that comes with losing your job. This isn't the first time he has been fired by Kaczynski. He lost his job 10 years ago, after the PiS won the parliamentary election. At the time, the new director of the radio network called him to tell him that he had been fired. Within an hour, his business mobile phone and the gas charge card for his official car had been frozen.&#xA;The second time around, three representatives of the new radio council, which is loaded with PiS appointees, came to his office and asked: &quot;Do you confess?&quot;&#xA;&quot;Confess? To what?&quot; Dabrowa replied.&#xA;&quot;Well,&quot; the PiS people said, &quot;to, uh, having played the national hymn?&quot;&#xA;In protest against the encroachments on the constitutional court and the media, Dabrowa had indeed broadcast either the national anthem or Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; at the top of every hour. &quot;It's ironic that the national conservatives fired me for playing the anthem,&quot; he says, hardly able to conceal his glee over this absurdity. Now he has a lot of time to play with his daughter and walk his dog in the neighborhood, where Kaczynski also happens to live.&#xA;&quot;The PiS doesn't want pluralism in culture and the media,&quot; says Dabrowa. &quot;It wants a uniform narrative.&quot; That narrative reads: The Poles are a proud, Catholic people, who were given a raw deal, especially by the Germans and the Russians; but the country has pulled itself together and taken a stand against its former occupiers. History as a heroic epic, the nation united against domestic and foreign enemies, Catholic, free of Western quirks like gay marriage and exaggerated hospitality for Syrian war refugees -- this is what Kaczynski wants for Poland.&#xA;Dabrowa fears that Kaczynski's next project will be to spin the causes of the Smolensk plane crash. Two investigation committees concluded that the aircraft carrying then President Lech Kaczynski, Jaroslaw's brother, crashed in 2010 because of mistakes made by the Russian control tower and the Polish crew. But for the national conservatives, Lech Kaczynski was the victim of a treacherous Russian assassination. This is an interpretation that the public radio network consistently opposed when it was headed by Dabrowa. The journalist believes that Kaczynski sees himself surrounded by dark powers hostile to the Poles, which is why he uses similarly inscrutable methods to shape his own policies.&#xA;One of those, according to Dabrowa, was the appointment of Kaczynski confidant Mariusz Kamiski as intelligence services coordinator. &quot;He will use the services to fight political battles. There will be provocations, and I wouldn't be surprised if child pornography suddenly turned up on the computers of PiS opponents or rumors emerged about drug abuse.&quot; This is why Dabrowa is pleased that the EU now plans to scrutinize his country to ensure that constitutional standards are upheld.&#xA;A Former Leader Changes Sides&#xA;The fact that Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz agrees is at least somewhat astonishing. A devout Catholic, math teacher and father of four children, he was also the leader of a PiS administration 10 years ago.&#xA;He was only in office for eight months, during which he performed his duties diligintly and inconspicuously -- and was rewarded with outstanding approval ratings. Then Marcinkiewicz apparently became too powerful for Kaczynski, and he was transferred to a job with the European Development Bank in London. There, Marcinkiewicz, a buttoned-down conservative until then, underwent a series of transformations, becoming both a critic of Kaczynski and a darling of the tabloid press. He left his wife and children for an attractive woman 22 years younger than him, bought designer suits and grew stylish stubble. The new relationship is over, and Marcinkiewicz now works as a business consultant in Warsaw, where he can sometimes be seen drinking tomato juice in the afternoon at the bar of the Hilton Hotel.&#xA;In a 2003 referendum, his country voted in favor of the EU and its principles, he says. &quot;That's why, of course, Brussels has the right to determine whether we are actually adhering to those principles.&quot; Although PiS has the absolute majority in the parliament, says Marcinkiewicz, low voter turnout means that only about a fifth of Poles actually voted for the party. Polls show that enthusiasm for the EU is still very high. &quot;This means that Jaroslaw Kaczynski has no mandate to turn Poland into an outsider within the EU.&quot;&#xA;Marcinkiewicz's clients, all managers of large corporations and banks, are beginning to hint that they would withdraw from Poland if the government followed Hungary's lead and imposed special taxes on international companies.&#xA;Marcinkiewicz says that he is still a conservative, but that it doesn't mean he supports the PiS. The new government must protect minorities, whether it likes them or not. Instead, says Marcinkiewicz, Kaczynski is ruthlessly using his majority to gain total control over all aspects of life. &quot;I'll be at the next demonstration,&quot; says the ex-premier, &quot;because I'm worried about Poland.&quot;&#xA;Translated from the German by Christopher Sultan&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

But why now?" content="Why Has Angela Merkel Staked Her Legacy on the Refugees?&#xA;The Isolated Chancellor: What Is Driving Angela Merkel?&#xA;By Markus Feldenkirchen and René Pfister&#xA;AP&#xA;Chancellor Angela Merkel spent a decade amassing political capital. Now, with the refugee crisis showing no signs of abating, she has decided to spend it. With her legacy in the balance, she has finally found an issue to fight for. But why now?&#xA;On a Sunday evening in early January, Angela Merkel went to a piano concert by Antonio Acunto in the Konzerthaus on Berlin's beautiful Gendarmenmarkt. The program included works from Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Schumann, but the chancellor didn't just come for the music. It was also for a good cause and to show support. The concert was a benefit for the refugees. Her refugees.&#xA;Shortly before the concert began, Merkel saw an old acquaintance: Reverend Rainer Eppelmann. In 1990, Eppelmann was head of the Democratic Awakening, a party formed in East Germany soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Merkel was its spokesperson. The party was ultimately folded into the Christian Democratic Union, of which Merkel is now the head.&#xA;At the concert, Eppelmann told Merkel how courageous and wonderful he thought her refugee policies were. Given the situation in which Merkel is now in, Eppelmann said, he finds himself thinking often about his favorite quote from the former Czech president and writer Vaclav Havel. &quot;Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.&quot;&#xA;The concert began and Merkel listened to a melancholic Chopin ballad in G-minor. When the intermission arrived, she jumped up from her chair and walked directly over to Eppelmann. She asked: &quot;How did that quote about hope go again?&quot;&#xA;It is completely unclear how the experiment will end that the German chancellor has forced upon the European Continent, upon her fellow citizens and, not least, upon her party. Her decision late last summer to open the German border to refugees transformed Merkel into a historic figure. It was the most consequential decision of her entire decade in office. The US newsmagazine Time named her Person of the Year and in the fall, she was widely considered to be in the running for the Nobel Peace Prize.&#xA;Since then, the mood has shifted , and not just in Germany. To prevent &quot;a rebirth of 1930s-style political violence,&quot; New York Times columnist Ross Douthat recently wrote, &quot;Angela Merkel must go.&quot;&#xA;Within Merkel's conservatives, there are those who have begun envisioning a government without the party's current leader. At the beginning of last week, Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), openly criticized Merkel, something that generally isn't done. In the past, mutiny on the part of government-level ministers has been a sign that a chancellor may soon be forced out of office.&#xA;The Rough Draft of Merkel's Downfall&#xA;The screenplay for Merkel's downfall hasn't yet been written, but an initial rough draft already exists. CSU head Horst Seehofer intends to heap pressure on Merkel for as long as it takes until she changes course. He isn't trying to push her out of office, but if she doesn't acquiesce, there are some in the conservative camp who could easily imagine Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble taking over the reins of government.&#xA;It hasn't come that far yet, but a critical mass is slowly coalescing. In a letter to the chancellor last week, 44 conservative parliamentarians voiced their opposition to Merkel's course. On Wednesday, Austria announced the introduction of a cap on refugees. The chancellor is becoming increasingly isolated.&#xA;As much as the decision to open the borders itself, what amazes many observers is the stubbornness with which Merkel has maintained her political course. Neither the terror attacks in Paris nor the sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in Cologne -- neither the indignation of furious German citizens nor the warnings from within her own party -- has led Merkel to question her decision to keep Germany's borders open. It seems as though Angela Merkel -- à la Vaclav Havel -- is convinced that her course of action makes sense. No matter how the situation turns out.&#xA;&quot;The German people are going to riot. The German people are going to end up overthrowing that woman,&quot; Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump predicted in mid-January. &quot;I don't know what the hell she is thinking.&quot;&#xA;Trump isn't the only one who has questions. Half the world is wondering what is motivating the German chancellor. What's the answer? What's driving Angela Merkel, a woman who gained power by virtue of her implacable pragmatism and who is now governing so unconditionally? Why has she thus far shown no serious indication that she might shift course on refugee policy despite the fact that her popularity ratings are plummeting and the foundations of her power are crumbling?&#xA;Merkel's chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, has a beautiful office in the Chancellery with a view of Berlin's central train station and of the government quarter. But the thick windows keep out the din of the city -- such that the most conspicuous quality of the seat of government is the silence inside. Altmaier is the voice of Merkel's refugee policy, even if, as the interview takes place, he is suffering from a terrible cold. From Merkel's perspective, Altmaier explains, this is what the world looks like: In order to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe late last summer, she had little choice but to open the borders. Now, the task is that of preventing Europe from falling apart. Were Germany to now close its borders, it wouldn't just mark a failure for Europe's border-free travel regime known as Schengen. The refugee flow would also backup across the Balkans and would destabilize the fragile young democracies there.&#xA;A Chain of Political Necessities&#xA;Greece would become overrun with desperate refugees from Syria and Iraq while Jordan and Lebanon, which are already hosting almost 2 million refugees, could be pushed to the brink of collapse. The alternative is a deal with Turkey , the country through which almost all the refugees have to travel.&#xA;That, at least, is the official version. When speaking with Merkel's people, her refugee policies come across as being entirely rational. Like a chain of political necessities.&#xA;One reason that Merkel has been able to stay in the Chancellery for so long is that she has never fought for a larger political project. She had no great political goals. She liked playing the role of crisis chancellor, similar to Helmut Schmidt before her. But now, at this late phase of her rule, she suddenly resembles an early Willy Brandt, the visionary.&#xA;It's not that Merkel had no convictions when she moved into the Chancellery in 2005. Having grown up in East Germany, she believed in the power of freedom and of the markets. But because voters weren't particularly enamored of her reform proposals in 2005, she dropped them. And early on, she hardly spoke at all about her East German origins or her faith.&#xA;That reticence was an element of her success, enabling her to avoid alienating western Germans, atheists and faithful Catholics. Over time, she rose to become the most popular of all politicians in Germany -- and she remained there. Early last summer, she was way ahead in all of the polls and she had collected a significant amount of political capital. The question was if she would ever spend it.&#xA;On July 15, Merkel met a 13-year-old girl named Reem Sahwil at a town meeting in the northern German city of Rostock. The girl had fled to Germany from Lebanon four years before but she was now in danger of being deported. &quot;It is really painful to see others really enjoying life when you can't enjoy life yourself,&quot; the girl said.&#xA;It was the old Merkel who answered. She didn't want to seem heartless, but she also didn't want to make any promises just because she had stumbled into an awkward situation. &quot;(If we would say) you can all come from Africa, and you can all come -- we couldn't handle that,&quot; Merkel stammered. Couldn't handle it. Not long after Merkel finished, Reem began crying and Merkel awkwardly tried to comfort her. In the days that followed, Merkel was accused of being cold-hearted and she was widely criticized on the Internet.&#xA;Bundesregierung.de&#xA;Merkel tries to comfort Reem Sahwil at a town meeting in Rostock on July 15, 2015.&#xA;A Lynch-Mob Atmosphere&#xA;At the end of August, she and her spokesman Steffen Seibert traveled to Heidenau. The town in Saxony is home to a former DIY store that had been transformed into a refugee shelter -- and in front of which right-wing hooligans had rioted a few days earlier. As Merkel's motorcade pulled up, she was received by a furiously whistling crowd. As she climbed back into her car an hour later, a woman yelled: &quot;Cunt! Get back into your ugly car!&quot; Even much later, Seibert was still talking about the lynch-mob atmosphere .&#xA;In the days that followed, something changed in the Chancellery. When Merkel gave her annual summer press conference on August 31, she no longer said that Germany is unable to take everybody. Neither did she speak of the risk of being overwhelmed, like she had in Rostock. &quot;Germany is a strong country,&quot; Merkel said. &quot;The motivation with which we should approach these things has to be: We have handled so much. We can handle it!&quot;&#xA;Merkel had decided to fight for an issue. She had saved for so long and carefully protected her power -- now she was intent on spending her political capital. It was only then that the Germans began getting to know the real Angela Merkel.&#xA;On Sept. 4, she opened up the border to the refugees trapped in Hungary. Later, she said that she had watched on television as people from Syria had gathered in the Keleti train station in Budapest and were then prevented from continuing their journey. She found it outrageous. Merkel decided to allow the refugees to come to Germany. Three days later, she said she was &quot;a bit proud of our country.&quot;&#xA;From then on, the numbers of refugees coming to Germany began to climb rapidly. Soon, it was 10,000 per day -- and as the influx grew, so too did the number of Merkel's critics. Bavarian Governor Seehofer said that Merkel had made a mistake that would affect Germany for a long time to come. It was a sentence that helped transform the refugee issue into a power struggle. Until then, Merkel had always been flexible. She used to be in favor of general conscription, and then she got rid of it. She was against shutting down Germany's nuclear power plants, and then she was in favor. &quot;But she isn't flexible when she is under pressure,&quot; says one of her confidants. &quot;Perhaps that is her greatest blemish.&quot;&#xA;On Oct. 6, she was sitting in a plane bringing her back to Berlin from a trip to India. She could certainly have used a bit of relaxation, but Merkel wanted to explain herself. She could feel that the questions were becoming more pressing and her answers less convincing.&#xA;Everything Was Connected&#xA;She had a paper brought to her from the cockpit showing the plane's route from Bangalore to Berlin and, surrounded by reporters, her finger wandered across the map, pointing at Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Germany. For her, it was more than just a piece of paper, it was confirmation of her policies: a clear indication that Germany could no longer simply isolate itself. To Merkel, it showed that everything was connected to everything else.&#xA;The Germans may wish for a time prior to the refugee crisis, but that is a wish she cannot fulfill, Merkel said. Of course she could close the borders, but then masses of people would accumulate in front of the barbed wire. The images would be ugly. Germans, she said, can't even stand it when someone is forced to spend the night outside.&#xA;She, though, wanted to combat the causes of the refugee crisis at the roots and cooperate with Turkey, Merkel said. As long as she was leading, Germany would not become a country that intentionally chased away people in need. &quot;I will not become involved in a competition for who can treat the refugees the worst,&quot; she said. It is a sentence full of pride, and one with a tiny bit of defiance directed at Seehofer as well.&#xA;One day later, in an appearance on a popular prime-time political talk show moderated by Anne Will, she repeated her message from the airplane almost word for word. Merkel, for whom almost nothing is less appealing than being forced to talk on television, smiled often during that talk show. On many other issues, you can see by the way she speaks that she doesn't really care about what she's saying. But on this issue, it is completely different. &quot;She was more passionate than usual,&quot; says Will, who has interviewed Merkel several times, in hindsight. During the show, Will says, she often thought to herself: &quot;She seems looser, more unfettered in her choice of words. She seemed at peace with herself, almost gleeful. That was new.&quot;&#xA;Merkel, of course, also saw the refugee crisis in the light of realpolitik. She has long pursued the goal of stealing centrist voters away from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). The difficulties the SPD has had in recent years are also a product of Merkel's active involvement in almost all issues near and dear to the left. The CDU has long pursued the goal of ensuring that no party could establish itself to its right on the political spectrum. But, says a close confidant only half joking, &quot;Merkel is the first CDU leader who has pursued the goal of ensuring that no party to the left of the CDU can establish itself.&quot;&#xA;Yet if it had only been about tactics, Merkel would have abandoned her approach long ago, at the latest when the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) began rising in the polls and her own popularity figures began dropping. There must be a different, more personal motivation, for her unwillingness to change course.&#xA;Building a Fence&#xA;At the end of October, she went to a summit in Brussels involving the countries along the Balkan Route, the trail used by most refugees to get to Germany. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who built a barbed wire fence around his country to keep out the migrants, was also there. He saw, and enjoyed, seeing Merkel in a fix. He took the floor and said: &quot;It is only a matter of time before Germany builds a fence. Then I'll have the Europe that I believe is right.&quot;&#xA;Merkel said nothing at first, a person present at the meeting relates. Only later, after a couple other heads of government had their say, did Merkel turn to Orbán and say: &quot;I lived behind a fence for too long for me to now wish for those times to return.&quot; Merkel, the refugee crisis has made clear, has found the courage to justify her politics with her own biography. She no longer wants to be the woman without a face.&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Graphic: Moving the Schengen border north.&#xA;&quot;It is an astounding late-life friendship,&quot; Klaus von Dohnanyi, the Social Democrat and former Hamburg mayor, says of his relationship with Angela Merkel. They meet regularly, usually together with their spouses, and only rarely talk politics. More often, they chat about concerts they have been to recently, visits to the theater and the natural sciences.&#xA;Dohnanyi knew Merkel's parents and he believes that her Christian roots are very apparent in her approach to the refugee crisis. &quot;She is the daughter of a socialist pastor. And her mother was an extremely devout woman. Such things are deep within you, they don't just disappear,&quot; he says. The Kasner family (Merkel is the name of the chancellor's first husband) adhered to a practical form of theology that involved helping the poor, sick and disadvantaged, Dohnanyi says.&#xA;Merkel grew up with the tenet that, if a stranger is standing in the rain before your door, you let him in and help, he continues. &quot;And when you let them in, you don't grimace,&quot; Dohnanyi says. &quot;Christians don't do that.&quot; Merkel herself recently said something similar. &quot;We hold speeches on Sundays and we talk about values. I am the chair of a Christian political party. And then people come to us from 2,000 kilometers away and then you're supposed to say: You can't show a friendly face here anymore?&quot;&#xA;Pastor Eppelmann is likewise convinced that Merkel's approach to the refugee crisis is deeply rooted in her past. &quot;She stands on a solid foundation that was poured in her childhood and youth.&quot; He also points out that her childhood home was not a normal Protestant parsonage, rather it was a church-run home for people with disabilities. Angela Kasner grew up surrounded by disabled people who needed to be cared for. &quot;She breathed in empathy like air and oxygen,&quot; says Eppelmann.&#xA;Later, Eppelmann goes on, Merkel also experienced what it is like to be pushed around by a regime. She initially was not granted a slot at university despite being best in her class. &quot;Such an experience can break a person,&quot; Eppelmann says. As such, Merkel can understand what it must be like for people fleeing Islamic State or the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria.&#xA;The Protestant Parsonage&#xA;The most important element, though, was the evangelical parsonage, emphasizes Eppelmann, who also worked as a pastor in East Germany. One &quot;becomes aware of a certain ethical standards regarding how life should be led.&quot; That includes that one shouldn't value oneself more than other people, no matter where they come from, Eppelmann says.&#xA;Every day, Jesus and God were discussed in the Kasner household, Eppelmann continues. The daily message was: &quot;Love thy neighbor as yourself. Not just German people. God loves everybody.&quot; You should compare the Protestant Church's statement on the refugee crisis with Merkel's words, Eppelmann suggests. &quot;They are virtually identical.&quot;&#xA;When Merkel spoke to the CDU party convention in the middle of December, her speech was indeed reminiscent of a sermon. She recalled significant CDU achievements from the past, such as binding Germany to the West and reunification, which former chancellors Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl had pushed through against opposition and doubt. Then she presented her own policies as the heir to these miracles of Christian Democracy.&#xA;&quot;The founding of the CDU was in reality an outrageous idea,&quot; she said. &quot;A party that finds its foundation in C, in the God-given dignity of each individual person. That means that today, it isn't a mass of people that is coming to us. It means they are individuals.&quot; When she stopped speaking after an hour, even the doubters and skeptics applauded her speech. For nine full minutes. Only one member of the audience seemed unimpressed: Wolfgang Schäuble, Merkel's finance minister.&#xA;Schäuble, despite the sweater thrown over his shirt, is a bit chilly. It is the end of November and Schäuble spent four hours that morning in parliament, where it is always a bit drafty. But he hadn't wanted to leave early. Merkel was delivering her speech on the Chancellery budget and Schäuble didn't want it to look once again as though he wanted nothing to do with her policies.&#xA;Only a few days earlier, Schäuble had compared the chancellor to a clumsy skier who triggers an avalanche on a steep slope. It was an image that provided confirmation to those who blame Merkel for the flood of refugees arriving in Europe. In the papers, there were stories claiming that Schäuble was prepared to take over for Merkel if necessary. But is that accurate?&#xA;German conservatives believe that only Schäuble would be able to fill Merkel's shoes. He was chief of staff in the Chancellery back when Merkel was still working as a scientist at East Germany's Academy of Sciences. He has also served as interior minister, CDU head and CDU floor leader in parliament. Now, at age 73, he embodies the hopes of those who would like to see the back of Merkel.&#xA;Searching for a Cap&#xA;Schäuble believes Merkel was right to open up Germany's borders to refugees stranded in Hungary on that night in early September. But he would like to have seen an indication from her at the same time that Germany cannot continue accepting refugees without limits.&#xA;In mid-September, he encouraged Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière to demand that a system be created whereby Europe would accept a certain number of refugees -- as a way to cap the numbers coming to Germany. De Maizière took his advice and made the proposal in the form of an interview with DER SPIEGEL that appeared on Sept. 19.&#xA;It didn't take long, however, for both SPD head and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel and Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert to distance themselves from de Maizière's proposal, much to Schäuble's chagrin. Not long later, Schäuble had a meeting with Merkel in the Chancellery. You can't just leave de Maizière fluttering in the wind, he complained. Merkel responded that Seibert had no other choice because the SPD, Merkel's junior coalition partner, would not have gone along with de Maizière's proposal. But SPD voters also want to see a reduction in the number of refugees coming to Germany, which is why Gabriel would ultimately come around, Schäuble insisted. &quot;They wouldn't stick to their rejection for even three days,&quot; he said.&#xA;In recent years, Schäuble has developed an elder-statesmanlike aura, but when it comes to domestic policy, he was long a hardliner. He believes that Merkel pays too little attention to the sensitivities of the right wing. Had it been up to him, he would have drastically cut benefits available to asylum-seekers while demanding that they pay for at least part of their German lessons. Schäuble is uninterested in the fact that Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ruled a few years ago that the state cannot simply continue cutting asylum-seeker benefits. &quot;I'll throw out any constitutional consultant who says such a thing,&quot; he growled to his people.&#xA;Schäuble has perfected the art of playing the dissident role without openly contradicting the chancellor. He is a loyalist and a rebel at the same time -- which helps explain his popularity and the fact that he has passed up Merkel in the opinion polls. When he was asked by the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper a few days ago whether he follows Merkel in the refugee crisis out of conviction or out of loyalty, he responded: &quot;You can't ask such a question to an intelligent person.&quot; It was another typical Schäuble sentence that allows for a number of different interpretations. Of all senior politicians in Berlin, it is Schäuble who is most likely to play Brutus.&#xA;Not long after comparing Merkel to a skier who triggered an avalanche, Schäuble called the chancellor to apologize. But as he often does, he threw in a bit of devilish humor. &quot;Comparing you to a skier was wrong, that hardly fits you,&quot; he said. One has to remember that two years ago Merkel broke her pelvis while cross-country skiing despite her extremely slow pace. One can definitely not imagine her powder skiing on a steep slope.&#xA;But how far will he go? Merkel's people comfort themselves with the fact that Schäuble has never before risked an open rebellion. He didn't attempt to topple Helmut Kohl when the chancellor refused to make way for a younger generation of CDU politicians in the 1990s. And when Merkel kept Greece in the euro zone against his will, he also declined to revolt.&#xA;Coldly Rational&#xA;Yet even today, it is difficult for Schäuble to accept his position as number two in the party behind Merkel. It was Schäuble, after all, who promoted Merkel to the position of CDU general secretary back in 1998, only to see her replace him as party chair after he stumbled over the same donation scandal that has tainted Kohl's legacy. In moments of clarity, it is clear to him that he is actually too old to take over the Chancellery. On the other hand, though, wasn't Adenauer also 73 when he became chancellor?&#xA;Ultimately, everything depends on CSU head Horst Seehofer. Like Schäuble, his political view is generally a coldly rational one, but at times he too sees the world through the lens of past political affronts, the unavoidable product of a long career in the public eye. Recently, Seehofer has been issuing new threats and ultimatums on a weekly basis. He has the reputation of being a flip-flopper, but in the refugee crisis, he has pursued the same strategy from the very beginning. It is a strategy based on numbers: Germany can accept refugees, but a million each year is too many. No chancellor can hold out long against such an influx, Seehofer believes.&#xA;&quot;When the situation drifts completely out of control, it will no longer be possible to restrain the political mood in the country.&quot; Seehofer uttered that sentence on Nov. 3, 2015. It was a Tuesday and Seehofer was in the Bavarian representation in Berlin. He had spent the previous weekend in the capital for meetings on the refugee crisis.&#xA;One of those meetings was a 10-hour marathon with Merkel in the Chancellery, along with Chief of Staff Altmaier, conservative floor leader Volker Kauder and Gerda Hasselfeldt, who is head of the group of CSU federal parliamentarians from Bavaria. The Bavarians were trying to convince the others of the necessity of capping the number of refugees coming to Germany, but Merkel and Altmaier were having none of it. In the end, they agreed that the number of refugees coming to Germany had to drop. Merkel herself wrote down the decisive sentence.&#xA;&quot;The chancellor herself retrieved the paper. It was a formulation marathon,&quot; Seehofer said afterwards. &quot;At the moment we are very pleased with the paper,&quot; he added with a crooked smile. The formulation represented his first small victory in the battle with Merkel. For Seehofer, the struggle isn't just about refugee numbers. It is also about the future of the CSU, which has always derived its disproportionate power from the fact that it consistently wins absolute majorities in Bavarian state elections. &quot;The CDU can afford it if its support slides below 40 percent. But for us, it is existential,&quot; Seehofer says.&#xA;From Seehofer's perspective, Merkel committed her cardinal sin when she opened the doors to the refugees trapped in Hungary. That night, she tried to reach Seehofer by mobile phone. But he was sleeping and didn't answer -- at least according to his version of events. When she finally got through to him the next morning, she knew the precise time she had tried to reach him the night before. It sounded as though she had a bad conscience.&#xA;'A Very Receptive Country'&#xA;&quot;We won't be able to handle it,&quot; Seehofer said of the number of refugees now making their way to Germany.&#xA;&quot;I'm saddened to hear you say that,&quot; Merkel responded.&#xA;Looking back, Seehofer says the chancellor made a huge mistake despite having the best intentions. From his perspective, it would still have been possible to impose order on the situation later. One could have declared that the opening of the border was a humanitarian exception. But when Merkel defended her decision at a press conference on Sept. 7 with Vice Chancellor Gabriel, she said something different. &quot;Germany is a receptive country,&quot; she said.&#xA;Seehofer has a theory about dealing with political mistakes: Problems are not the consequence of erroneous decisions, but of the inability to rapidly correct them. &quot;Often, politicians are doomed by the beta mistakes,&quot; he says. It becomes particularly problematic, he says, when the initial mistake is justified with a political philosophy. For Seehofer, Merkel's fatal philosophy her idea of a Wilkommenskultur, of welcoming the refugees.&#xA;He says he doesn't think Merkel consciously intended to put her position at risk. &quot;She is of an age when you no longer give up power willingly. She might cook for her husband every now and then, but politics is her life,&quot; Seehofer says. The beginning of the end for every chancellor, he says, is when the distance to the party's grassroots begins to grow. Helmut Schmidt fell when he agreed to allow NATO to station nuclear missiles in West Germany, he notes, and Gerhard Schröder fell when he cut unemployment and retirement benefits.&#xA;Merkel, he continues, is certainly able to correct her mistakes. He leans back and thinks back to 2004, a time when conservatives in Germany were bickering about far-reaching reform plans -- plans that Seehofer felt were neo-liberal aberrations. When Merkel came within a hair's breadth of losing the 2005 election, she simply discarded her reform plans. &quot;There was no official funeral,&quot; Seehofer says. Were Merkel to now correct her course in the refugee crisis, Seehofer says she wouldn't admit it. &quot;She would never say that it had been wrong.&quot;&#xA;It may be that Merkel never admits to making mistakes. But it is more likely that she is convinced she is doing the right thing. And that, in part, has to do with people like Hassan Alasad. He's wearing a dark blue sweater-vest over a light blue shirt and sitting in a shelter in northwest Berlin. Two mobile phones are lying in front of him. He takes one of them and begins swiping through photos. Of course he still has it: He will always have it with him, for his entire life.&#xA;The photo, which transformed the Syrian refugee into a symbol, shows him next to the chancellor smiling into the mobile phone camera. It is perhaps the most famous selfie of 2015 and it was quickly shared around the world. It became symbolic of Germany's efforts to welcome the refugees -- efforts that are now synonymous with Merkel's name and that have led her to the low point of her political career.&#xA;'An Amazing Feeling'&#xA;It was Sept. 10 when Merkel visited the shelter, where Alasad still lives. She seemed so friendly, so approachable, he now says, that he spontaneously asked her for a selfie. Back home, Alasad explains, it was impossible to ever approach those in power. In 12 years, he never even shook hands with the mayor of his own hometown. &quot;Then, I had only been in Germany for just a couple of days and the chancellor comes by in person to greet us.&quot; Alasad shakes his head and laughs. &quot;That was an amazing feeling.&quot;&#xA;DPA&#xA;Chancellor Angela Merkel takes a selfie with Hassan Alasad in Berlin on Sept. 10, 2015 in Berlin.&#xA;Friends from around the world called him after the photo began to go viral: from Dubai, from Belgrade and even from Afghanistan. It was printed in countless newspapers and Internet sites. He saved almost all of them in his mobile phone.&#xA;&quot;I thought Germany was a paradise,&quot; Alasad says. &quot;The most orderly country in the world. A country with structures.&quot; His vision of Germany is everything that his homeland doesn't have. Before bombs destroyed his office and warehouse, Hassan Alasad was a businessman. He didn't want to leave Syria, but he felt useless there, a feeling he had had for quite some time. When he and his brother went to a lake one day and airplanes dropped bombs that ripped apart friends and acquaintances, they decided to leave Syria.&#xA;On Jan. 5, Merkel was in the lobby of the Chancellery to listen to the Sternsinger children's choir as she does every year in early January. She sang along with the boys and girls to a Biblical song called &quot;We Saw His Star in the East.&quot; At one point, it looked almost as though Merkel had to wipe away a tear from the corner of her eye.&#xA;Then she held a brief address. She noted that people now see the Sternsinger, who go from house to house singing carols on the Epiphany, as cultural heritage. But in actuality, she went on, it is a Christian tradition. The motto of the Sternsinger is respect, and respect is also anchored in the German constitution, where it says that human dignity is inviolable, she said. But that doesn't just apply to Germans and Europeans. &quot;Rather it also applies to all people -- to every person as God's creature.&quot; Her approach to the refugees, it seemed, hadn't changed with the New Year.&#xA;Still, since that November day she spent with Seehofer in the Chancellery, the situation has become more acute almost by the day. The number of refugees arriving in Germany has dropped slightly, but that could change again soon once winter storms subside. Seehofer has continued steering his party into a conflict with Merkel and since the sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in Cologne, the hate felt in broad swaths of the populace for Merkel's refugee policies has only intensified.&#xA;No Mood to Admit Defeat&#xA;&quot;We have to continually urge each other on so that we can change things for the good,&quot; Merkel told the Sternsinger. It was a touching sentence. Merkel is doing her best to fight against the growing numbers, particularly since Cologne, of those who would like to see her fail -- and against the increasingly sneering sentiment that her approach was a naive attempt to make the world more humane.&#xA;Her confidants these days are in no mood to admit defeat. At most, they will own up to minor mistakes: the tweet sent out by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees on August 25, for example, which gave the impression that Germany was opening its doors to all Syrian refugees. But it is obvious to all that Merkel has lost control of refugee policy. There is a discrepancy between that which she feels is right and the side effects these policies are having on her country. It seems as though she is playing for time, but the game doesn't look to be turning in her favor.&#xA;Angela Merkel wanted to give Germany a friendly, humanitarian face. And it worked for a few weeks. But now, the German face has become a grimace. It is no longer the unburdened, smiling face of Merkel, but that of the grim Pegida marchers and AfD populists. In fact, AfD has ridden its refugee opposition to unprecedented opinion poll highs of over 10 percent in recent surveys.&#xA;Merkel is disappointed that her party and the German people ultimately declined to follow her lead. But she herself failed to link her message of welcome together with a solid plan for at least halfway controlling the influx of refugees. That is ultimately what caused the mood in Germany to shift, what triggered opposition in the rest of Europe and what propelled the right-wing populists to unprecedented heights. That is also on Merkel.&#xA;The Greatest Surprise of All&#xA;Even Hassan Alasad, Merkel's selfie partner, now has a different image of Germany than he did four months ago. Although there is nothing that would get in the way of him being officially recognized as a refugee -- which would allow him to work -- he still hasn't received his papers. Each week, he stands in line in front of the relevant office, but thus far his efforts have been in vain. The officials have no time for him and are completely overwhelmed. Were Merkel to drop by for another visit, he says he would ask her what's wrong in her country.&#xA;It could still be that Merkel will find her way back to her old pragmatism and will pursue the Plan B of turning back most refugees at the Slovenian border. Such a plan would allow the continuation of border-free travel in the Schengen Zone, but it would mean that people would be stranded in the Balkans or in Greece -- and Germany would contribute to Europe showing its ugly face.&#xA;&quot;I would feel terribly sorry for her as a person if she were to get into a situation where she was forced to abandon her convictions and her past,&quot; says Eppelmann. &quot;But if it came to that, she would step down first.&quot;&#xA;Among all of the surprises that Merkel has sprung on the Germans in the past several months, that would be the greatest one of all.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

File photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images&#xA;Previous Image&#xA; &#xA; &#xA;A supporter of a Northern Irish baker which refused to bake a same-sex marriage-themed cake has welcomed an about-turn on the issue by a high-profile gay rights activist.&#xA;The supporter of Ashers Baking Company welcomed Peter Tatchell&#x2019;s &#x201c;U-turn&#x201d; in his stance on the case ahead of an appeal against the so-called &#x201c;gay cake&#x201d; judgment.&#xA;The Belfast Court of Appeal this Wednesday will hear an appeal by the company against last year&#x2019;s Belfast County Court decision which found Ashers guilty of discrimination against a gay rights advocate by refusing to bake him a cake with a slogan promoting same-sex marriage.&#xA;Ashers, which is run by the McArthur family and has six shops in the greater Belfast area, was ordered to pay £500 (&#x20ac;660) in compensation to Gareth Lee who, with the North&#x2019;s Equality Commission, took the case against the company.&#xA;Bert and Ernie&#xA;In May 2014, Ashers initially accepted an order for a cake for the Queerspace campaign group featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie and bearing the slogan, &#x201c;Support Gay Marriage&#x201d;.&#xA;The company, owned by Colin and Karen McArthur and managed by their son Daniel, subsequently declined the order on the basis it contravened their Christian beliefs.&#xA;In May last year, Judge Isobel Brownlie said Ashers was not a religious organisation but was &#x201c;in business for profit&#x201d;. She found the company was &#x201c;guilty of unlawful discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation&#x201d;.&#xA;The appeal, which opens on Wednesday morning, is expected to last two days.&#xA;This week Mr Tatchell, who initially supported the legal case against Ashers, said he had changed his mind. &#x201c;Much as I wish to defend the gay community, I also want to defend freedom of conscience, expression and religion,&#x201d; he wrote in the Guardian.&#xA;&#x2018;Infringement of freedom&#x2019;&#xA;&#x201c;In my view, it is an infringement of freedom to require businesses to aid the promotion of ideas to which they conscientiously object.

As a young woman, she worked on assembly lines in the textile and electronics industries before going to England at the age of 19 to train to become an international secretary. She then completed degrees in economics and worked as an investment banker in London and on Wall Street. She returned to Beijing in 1995 and founded the commercial real estate development firm SOHO China together with her husband Shiyi Pan. Unusually for a Chinese business leader, Zhang also speaks out regularly on social and political issues.&#xA;She sat down with SPIEGEL in Beijing for an interview as she prepared to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Zhang Xin, if China's economy was an enterprise and you were running it, how would you make your company fit for the future?&#xA;Zhang: No economy, no company, in fact no individual can develop its full potential today without embracing two fundamental trends -- globalization and digitalization. They will dominate for quite some time to come.&#xA;SPIEGEL: What does this mean for China?&#xA;Zhang: It means that the country needs to continue opening up and keep connecting. It needs to realize that the world has become one. The old concept of isolation, the idea that you can solve your problems on your own does not work anymore -- neither in cultural, economic, nor political terms. Isolation means a lack of growth. I grew up in China at a time when the country was completely isolated. That era is over.&#xA;SPIEGEL: The booms and busts on the market during the summer and at the beginning of the year have shattered confidence abroad in China's economic power. How do you evaluate the extreme volatility on the capital markets?&#xA;Zhang: Investors don't like uncertainty. The market is telling us that they need certainty, they need to see where the economy is heading. If the government is committed to continue the Open Door policy, they will need to come up with concrete policies and execution steps to increase confidence.&#xA;SPIEGEL: China's leadership wants to transform its economy from an investment-driven to a service- and consumption-driven one. Will that work?&#xA;Zhang: At the moment our consumption is still too small in terms of GDP. But we are heading in the right direction.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Many China watchers wonder if this transformation will work.&#xA;Zhang: The question is not about whether it will work or not. It's how quickly we can pull it off. Structural change will happen. When economies grow, there comes a time when you cannot rely on investment alone. We had that. The return on investment is becoming less and less. So we have to change. The old model doesn't work anymore. It's a question of speed.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Your company is one of China's largest real estate firms. How has your business model changed over the years?&#xA;Zhang: Twenty years ago, we were only able to build boxes. Today, architects from all over the world are working with us -- Zaha Hadid from London, Gerkan, Marg and Partner from Hamburg, Kengo Kuma from Japan. We brought design and digitalization from abroad to China.&#xA;SPIEGEL: In comparison, how did things start out for you?&#xA;Zhang: When we started out, we were among the first. Beijing had no and Shanghai had very few large buildings. At that time, it was all about building, building, building -- and then selling, selling, selling. We were working like a manufacturer. Soon, however, we realized that land was running out in Beijing and Shanghai. So we started keeping our buildings, and managing and renting them out. We became landowners. That was the second act.&#xA;SPIEGEL: And then?&#xA;Zhang: Then we moved on to Act 3. China's economy became more complex. By now there is a large number of small- and medium-sized companies that work quite differently from big, state-owned enterprises. They don't follow any long-term business plan and don't rent office space for years to come. They start out and need an office right away, for a week, a month or half a year, and they want to be among other entrepreneurs like themselves. Our tenants now are companies like Uber, the taxi service, Meituan.com, China's version of Groupon -- and a large number of startups. These companies operate in a modern way, just like their customers: They go on the Internet, look for an offer and take it.&#xA;SPIEGEL: After the stock market turbulences, does it surprise you that people have started to worry?&#xA;Zhang: China has consistently surprised us. When I returned from the United States 20 years ago, it was unimaginable that we would end up where we are now. What China has achieved defies all logic. I credit this to the hard work and enterprising spirit of the Chinese people.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Can you give an example?&#xA;Zhang: I am a runner. Last October, there was a marathon here in Beijing. I didn't participate this time, but friends told me that the run wasn't prepared too well. The organizers had only arranged about three hours' worth of food and water supplies. Most people don't finish within three hours, however. Too bad for them -- or so it seemed. In fact, however, even those finishing last were perfectly taken care of, particularly during the fourth and fifth hour when demand is highest.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Why?&#xA;Zhang: Because people along the route had realized that there was demand and quickly organized supply. That's so Chinese. In a well-organized country like Germany, such a problem may not have arisen in the first place, but in China people immediately recognized an opportunity.&#xA;SPIEGEL: No one will doubt the diligence and flexibility of the Chinese, but will this be enough to avoid a hard landing of China's economy?&#xA;Zhang: Growth will be slower, no one denies that. But the question is: Where are the chances and opportunities now? I see some positive and some negative trends. It's a good thing that it is getting simpler to register a company in China, it is good that the exchange rate of our currency is getting more flexible and that it's getting easier for Chinese businesspeople to travel. All of this opens up our economy. But it is a worry that there have been so many delays in the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. We all know that private companies are run more efficiently than state ones. These reforms are very much anticipated for the potential dynamism they could create.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Are you worried about the many employees who might be laid off when the reform of the state-owned enterprises takes off?&#xA;Zhang: China reformed its state sector before, in the late 1990s. Tens of millions were laid off at the time. That was scary and we had warnings of social unrest. But it did not happen. Instead, there was a restructuring in our economic system. I am not sure if China will follow a Western playbook in this respect.&#xA;SPIEGEL: How do you mean that?&#xA;Zhang: On the one hand the world is getting more integrated and we should not dismiss social values as &quot;Western&quot; when they are actually modern values. On the other hand, individual countries have their own history and their own evolution. Trade unions, for example, don't play the same role in China as they do in Europe or the US.&#xA;SPIEGEL: You and other entrepreneurs of your generation have shaped an economic era in China similar to what was known as the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; in 19th-century Germany. Is this era now coming to an end?&#xA;Zhang: When we started out, we didn't really think that the era of great opportunity would end one day. We were much too busy developing our companies. But in today's China you can build a city, even a mega-city like Beijing or Shanghai, within 10 or 15 years. And then you are done. So in real estate development, the Gründerzeit is over. But that is not the case in other sectors.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Such as?&#xA;Zhang: I firmly believe that digitalization has only just begun in China. In addition to the taxi, transport, shopping and hotel businesses, many other industries will follow: education, health care, administration, even the legal branch -- everything, really. There is still a lot of opportunity in China for the inventive and ambitious ones.&#xA;SPIEGEL: China's generation of founders has become rich over the past 20 years. What will you and the other 600 or so Chinese dollar billionaires do with your money?&#xA;Zhang: Mark Zuckerberg recently announced that he will donate $45 billion of his wealth to philanthropy. Two years ago, my husband and I decided to endow $100 million to set up the SOHO China Scholars. This program will give financial aid to Chinese students so they can attend the best universities in the world. Many Chinese entrepreneurs are now donating for education; others support foundations in health care and research. None of us wants to be the richest guy in the cemetery.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Europeans often see philanthropy as a sign that a state isn't doing enough in terms of social welfare and education.&#xA;Zhang: That may be true, but it is worthwhile to engage in something that is close to one's heart. I had a scholarship. So if I donate money to give brilliant Chinese students an opportunity to study abroad, then this embodies everything I believe in: education, globalization, social mobility. I am an example of social mobility.&#xA;SPIEGEL: In spite of its communist past, China often resembles America rather than Europe. Rich people earn admiration in China, not envy.&#xA;Zhang: I have a profound dislike for showing off one's material wealth. This is insensitive and it is not what human hearts are made for. But what I like about China and sometimes miss in Europe is the entrepreneurial spirit of our young people, their ambition and dynamism.&#xA;SPIEGEL: And the Chinese have this in common with the Americans?&#xA;Zhang: Yes, and I think this explains to some degree why private engagement and philanthropy will play a big role here. I used to ask myself why American universities are financed through endowments. Now I know: During the early days of America, the state was poor and when citizens wanted to set something up, they needed to collect money themselves. Historically, this was different in Europe. There used to be a strong state, a monarch or a king. He provided money.&#xA;SPIEGEL: In China there is a strong party. Can one get rich in China without the party?&#xA;Zhang: Our company has only been active in Beijing and Shanghai, two very market-dominated cities. This was an advantage. Land is purchased here in public auctions, in a transparent way. When you do real estate development outside Beijing and Shanghai it is good to have &quot;guanxi&quot; -- good relations within the local government.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, famously advised entrepreneurs to &quot;love the party but not to marry it.&quot;&#xA;Zhang: We are not very good at this. Our success rests on our international experience and on our ability to read the market. And I contest the notion that you can only succeed in China when you are well-connected. Neither my husband nor I are &quot;princelings&quot; -- children of influential people, that is. And yet China has enabled us to succeed.&#xA;Jonathan Browning / DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Zhang Xin, CEO of SOHO China: &quot;Isolation means a lack of growth.&quot;&#xA;SPIEGEL: The party, however, has become quite rigid, not just with Chinese but also with foreign businessmen.&#xA;Zhang: I think our legal system needs to be developed. Cases of citizens who are detained and then have to wait much too long for a trial -- that is scary, for everyone. When someone commits a crime he needs to be charged quickly. Why does this take so long in many cases? I don't know. Is it because our legal system is still rudimentary? China has promised to modernize its legal system. This has high priority.&#xA;SPIEGEL: When countries prosper economically there comes a time when its people start asking for greater political participation. Will this eventually happen in China, too?&#xA;Zhang: I said before that the Chinese no longer crave so much for food and accommodation, but they do crave democracy. I stand by that. I don't know which model China will follow. But the higher our standard of living, the higher our levels of education, the further people will look around. And we can see which level of openness other societies enjoy. We are no different -- we too want more freedom. The question is: How much freedom will be allowed?&#xA;SPIEGEL: Today the silhouettes of your buildings dominate the skylines of Beijing and Shanghai, almost serving as a signature of modern China. Have you ever wondered how long these buildings will continue to stand tall and just how sustainable these structures that you have created together with your architects will be?&#xA;Zhang: We have become so quick and effective in building things today. It would be easy to build another Pyramid of Giza or another Great Wall. But these buildings haven't withstood the test of time because of their building quality. They stand tall because they have a symbolic value, they represent a culture. I'm afraid what we are building today will not have the same impact and sustainability of the architecture of a 100, 500 or 1,000 years ago. The buildings of those days were miracles. We don't perform such miracles today. So we should be a little more modest. For my part, I'll be glad to show one of my buildings one day to my grandchildren and say: I'm proud of that.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

Shannon told investigators that he bought the books at a fair or fete for about Irl£300 and was using them to decorate his house.&#xA;Shannon of Willans Way, Ongar, Dublin pleaded not guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to possession of the books at his home while knowing or being reckless as to whether they were stolen on March 3rd, 2007.&#xA;After a five day trial and just under four hours of deliberation the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty.&#xA;Under the new EU directive on victims, transposed into Irish law last November, Judge Petria McDonnell invited the owners of Carton House to provide a victim impact report for the sentence hearing next April.&#xA;Conor Mallon gave evidence during the trial that he has worked at Carton House since 1994 overseeing its restoration after his father&#x2019;s company bought the estate in 1977.

Behind the scenes, though, Berlin is searching for a Plan B to solve the crisis. Is the country moving closer to closing its borders?&#xA;Sometimes, the greatest changes are announced very quietly. Each Thursday, representatives of the countries located along the refugee route that crosses the Balkans meet by video conference for a briefing on the current situation. Are there sufficient accommodations in Greece? Are there enough heated tents in Croatia. There are numerous organizational and administrative questions, and the whole affair has an almost routine feel to it.&#xA;Participating in the group on Germany's behalf is Uwe Corsepius, Chancellor Angela Merkel's European policy advisor. Last Thursday, he and his colleagues from Austria and Slovenia informed the others first talks were being conducted about, among other things, finding ways to better control Slovenia's borders.&#xA;That may not sound like much, but was nothing less than an announcement that Germany was making a strategic shift in its refugee policies. Merkel has been insistent that a European solution needs to be found for the crisis. But asked what this &quot;European solution&quot; might look like, officials are giving a different answer these days than they used to.&#xA;Previously, the official German position had been that refugees should be stopped at the European Union's external borders in Greece and Italy. The plan had been to open up large initial reception centers, so-called hotspots , where refugees would be registered and a decision made on their possible redistribution to other European countries. Merkel says she is still pursuing this plan.&#xA;The problem is that the opening of the hotspots is moving ahead extremely slowly. Greece in particular, the country through which most refugees are currently traveling to the European Union, isn't adhering to its obligations. It's one of the main reasons the number of refugees has not dropped in Germany to a degree that might reduce political pressure on Merkel .&#xA;'Not Helpful'&#xA;Instead, the opposite is happening. With its announcement that it wants to cap the number of refugees entering into Austria at 37,500 in 2016, Merkel has been pushed even further onto the defensive. The development &quot;is not helpful,&quot; the German chancellor admitted on Wednesday at a meeting CSU state parliamentarians in Bavaria. The CSU is the sister party of Merkel's CDU.&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Graphic: Moving the Schengen border north.&#xA;With the number of allies supporting Germany's approach in Europe shrinking, staff in Merkel's Chancellery are currently working on a Plan B, one that the CSU has been the most vehement in demanding. Officially, Merkel is denying the existence of any such plan. She doesn't want to create the impression that she is buckling under pressure from CSU head and Bavarian Governor Horst Seehofer, whose state, which shares a border with Austria, is feeling the brunt of the influx of refugees. But the government is nevertheless pursuing a Plan B, even if it looks a little different from the one envisioned by the CSU.&#xA;The chancellor continues to reject the setting an upper ceiling on refugees and imposing the strict border controls Seehofer is demanding. Merkel is concerned that doing so would mean the end of the Schengen zone of border-free travel within much of the EU. But there may also be a more elegant solution, one that was first introduced by the Austrian government.&#xA;Pushing Schengen North&#xA;The idea foresees Slovenia playing a key role -- as the first country after Greece along the West Balkan route that has an external Schengen border. The plan would envision stopping all migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Africa there. A growing number of migrants from these regions have been using the West Balkan route to get to Germany, despite the fact that they have little prospect of obtaining asylum protection once they get here. The plan would mean that Europe's internal borders to remain open.&#xA;Of the 1.83 million refugees that the EU border protection agency Frontex estimates came to Europe in 2015, some 227,000 came from Afghanistan. The number of North Africans who have entered is far lower, but in recent weeks, German authorities have observed a significant uptick in the number of migrants from countries in the Maghreb region like Algeria and Morocco.&#xA;Most have no chance of obtaining asylum status. By shifting the Schengen external border to Slovenia, refugees could be prevented from continuing their journey to Germany. The unspoken hope in Berlin is that Slovenia might make less of a fuss about the not uncontroversial legal aspects of the move than would likely be the case in Germany.&#xA;Daniel Thym, a European law professor at the University of Konstanz in Germany, says the question of whether officials at the Slovenian border can simply turn asylum-seekers away is an open one. He describes it as a &quot;legal gray area&quot; that surely isn't in the spirit of the original vision of the EU's Dublin Regulation on refugees. But, he added, it might be possible to create legal constructs that would make it permissible.&#xA;Divergent Views&#xA;At first glance, the plan looks like a solid one, but it also contains a number of shortcomings, as officials in Berlin well know. Slovenia would likely have trouble controlling so many refugees on its own. Thus far, Germany has sent around 10 federal police officers to Slovenia to help consult their colleagues there, but they do not have any actual border patrol responsibilities themselves. So far, there haven't been any additional requests for assistance, either.&#xA;It's also unclear whether the government in Ljubljana will even be willing to help. The question of what shape this border cooperation could take is also an open one. Officials in the German Interior Ministry say that Austria, which first approached the German government with the idea a few weeks ago, so far hasn't made any concrete proposal.&#xA;The reason may be that views in Berlin and Vienna over how the borders are to be controlled have diverged so strongly. The German government and the European Commission don't want to implement measures that could destabilize Greece or the countries bordering Slovenia. Countries like Serbia &quot;must not become a parking lot or 'no man's land' for stranded refugees,&quot; EU Expansion Minister Johannes Hahn said last fall. &quot;It's a matter of turning the wave around without chaos breaking out in the Balkans,&quot; one source in the European Commission said.&#xA;Some members of the Austrian government view things differently. On Wednesday, Vienna announced its intention to cap the number of asylum-seekers the country takes in. Shortly after the announcement, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said he believed a resulting traffic jam of refugees would create &quot;pressure&quot; on Europe to find a common solution for the refugee problem. &quot;If Greece can't better secure its external borders, there's unfortunately a risk that the country may soon have to temporarily leave the Schengen area,&quot; says Manfred Weber, the German head of the European People's Party group (the conservative Christian Democrats) in the European Parliament.&#xA;The German government wants to proceed more cautiously. &quot;It cannot be in our interest for the situation in the West Balkans and Greece to further deteriorate,&quot; says Michael Roth, a senior official with Germany's Foreign Ministry.&#xA;Tensions Between Berlin and Vienna&#xA;Without a coordinated effort between Berlin and Vienna, it's highly unlikely that this Plan B could be successful. But Austria's introduction of an upper ceiling has done little to improve those prospects. Sources close to Merkel describe the plans as &quot;grotesque.&quot; Although the Austrians have stated that they informed Berlin about the details of their refugee cap, no one in Berlin knows what will happen with the refugees who go beyond that limit. Inside the Austrian Foreign Ministry, officials aren't ruling out the possibility that they will simply be waved on to neighboring Germany. Slovenia is already doing that. The government announced on Thursday that in the future it would only allow refugees into the country that planned to submit their applications for asylum in Germany or Austria.&#xA;Nevertheless, there is unity between the countries on the issue of being able to deport asylum-seekers from Maghreb countries whose applications have been rejected. To that end, Germany wants to help these countries' embassies in Berlin in identifying the true origins of the refugees in question. Given that they often aren't carrying any legal ID papers, Germany would like to provide them with so-called EU Laissez Passer documents, thus making it easier to repatriate them to their countries of origin. &quot;The current multi-phase return system is too cumbersome,&quot; German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, of the center-left Social Democratic Party, wrote in a joint letter with Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière, of the Christian Democrats, addressed to their colleagues in North Africa. The letter also indicates countries will be rewarded if they cooperate.&#xA;And if none of that helps? At the end of the day, it may be the case that Germany has to reject massive numbers of asylum-seekers at its borders. During her visit to CSU representatives of the Bavarian state legislature on Wednesday, Merkel said that step could only be taken as a last resort.&#xA;'A Fundamentally New Situation'&#xA;Experts are also divided on the question of whether it is even legal for German police to implement such an order. In an internal analysis, officials at the Interior and Justice ministries came to the initial conclusion that, under the Dublin III Regulation, each EU member state has the right to send asylum-seekers trying to enter its borders to a safe third country. But it is unclear whether, in formal terms, another EU member state could also be considered a &quot;safe third country.&quot; The internal analysis concludes there would be &quot;inherent legal risks&quot; in doing so. But it appears to be tenable.&#xA;Furthermore, the paper states, a &quot;fundamentally new situation&quot; has arisen as a result of the &quot;current systemic failure of the European (external) border protection and asylum system&quot; with the &quot;transmission of thousands of people seeking protection to the German border,&quot; which has in turn necessitated measures to ensure public safety. Ultimately, however, any decision will have to be a political one.&#xA;&quot;You can attempt to justify such rejection of refugees at an internal EU border,&quot; says law professor Thym. However, he argues it is less certain that it would hold up in court. Either way, Thym concludes, Germany &quot;is currently in a political situation in which the law is given only secondary consideration.&quot;&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

In an interview in Davos, Germany's finance minister warns that time is running out. If Schengen collapses, he warns, the European Union is in trouble.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: Mr. Schäuble, the Austrian government recently announced plans to introduce upper limits to the number of refugees it will accept. Do you sympathize with their decision?&#xA;Schäuble: I had to gasp for breath a bit when I heard that we were not closely consulted on the decision. In recent months, the German chancellor has always made an effort to consult closely with Austria. But we know that the abilities of European Union member states are not infinite. As such, it makes little sense for us to criticize each other. All of us accepted Sweden's decision to introduce border controls too. And that is a country that was for decades the most open to immigration.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: Will Germany soon be completely alone with its refugee policies?&#xA;Schäuble: No. In the EU, we agree that the pressures causing migration must be reduced. If the Schengen system (of border-free travel) is destroyed, Europe will be seriously endangered -- politically and economically. That is why we Europeans have to invest billions in Turkey, Libya, Jordan and other countries in the region as quickly as possible -- everybody as much as they can.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: Your proposal for the introduction of a fuel tax to finance such aid was recently rebuffed. It wasn't even welcomed among your conservative allies in Germany.&#xA;Schäuble: At the moment, we are lucky to have a budgetary surplus and don't need such a tax. But Germany cannot handle this task on its own, that much is clear. That is why I suggested that countries with tighter finances think about such a tax. We don't have the time at the moment for months of discussion.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: But wouldn't it be easier to win support for a system with clear quotas for distributing the burden? Such a system already exists when it comes to financial aid for countries like Greece.&#xA;Schäuble: We are running out of time for such solutions. EU Council President Donald Tusk said we have until February. I had always hoped that the European Commission would come up with a plan before then. But I know that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is doing all he can.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: There was also a shortage of time when it came to bailing out the banks and some euro-zone member states. Nevertheless, provisional solutions were soon replaced by structures involving clear burden sharing. Shouldn't that be the case in the refugee crisis as well?&#xA;Schäuble: Yes, of course. But in contrast to the euro crisis, some of our EU partners this time think that the problem has no effect on them. I think they are wrong, but that is what they think.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: You just recently set aside the 12 billion budget surplus to take care of the costs associated with the refugee crisis. Where will all that money go?&#xA;Schäuble: About half of it has already been included in the 2016 budget -- to assist states and municipalities in providing shelter, for example. And it is clear to us that we will have to become more involved in our neighboring regions so that the migration pressures aren't so high there. Of course the budget negotiations will be difficult, as they always are. I think we will have to spend more on defense, for infrastructure, for extension of the broadband network and also for domestic security .&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: Do you believe that the sex attacks committed in Cologne on New Year's Eve make it more urgent to invest in security?&#xA;Schäuble: It has been clear for some time now that we have to do more for domestic and external security. I am prepared for that. And I was prepared even prior to Cologne.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: You have twice managed to submit a balanced budget. When looking ahead to continuing that trend, what worries you more: The possible effects of a crisis in China on Germany or the end of extremely low interest rates, which currently allow Germany to save billions?&#xA;Schäuble: I would actually rather have slightly higher interest rates.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: But that would make it difficult for you to balance your budget.&#xA;Schäuble: Yes, but at their current levels, interest rates are not fulfilling their economic function. That leads to extreme fluctuations. At the moment we are facing a whole collection of difficult to forecast developments -- from the situation in China and the oil-price crash to the worrying news from some banks in Europe and the US. All of that is linked: Worldwide company debt is high and there is a lot of money in circulation. That is why necessary structural reforms are not being made. I don't know how many resolutions from the IMF or G-20 we have already written saying that such reforms are necessary for new growth.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: The current situation on the markets reminds legendary US investor George Soros of the last large financial crisis.&#xA;Schäuble: Soros has earned a lot of money throughout his career with such rumors.&#xA;SPIEGEL ONLINE: So you aren't worried about a new crisis?&#xA;Schäuble: I just said that we are facing a whole collection of crisis-like developments that we have to watch closely. But we also have to be careful what we point to as crisis indicators. In China, it was always said that a double-digit rate of growth would be dangerous. Now, the country has a growth rate of 6.9 percent and suddenly that is supposed to be a catastrophe for the global economy. The significant collapse of oil prices also shows that it was previously way too high. Financial policy has to be careful not to constantly be driving such exaggerations. Our balanced budget has an important psychological function. It is a signal that we can't continue to constantly take on debt.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

Photograph: Bryan O&#x2019;Brien/The Irish Times.&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;A 29-year-old man who repeatedly stabbed a woman at a Kilkenny shopping centre suffered from a psychotic illness that remained untreated for years before the killing, a murder trial jury has heard.&#xA;Shane Smyth (29), with an address at McGuinness House, Evans Lane, Kilkenny, is charged with murdering Mairead Moran (26) on May 8th, 2014 at the Market Cross Shopping Centre in Kilkenny City.&#xA;Mr Smyth has pleaded not guilty to murdering Ms Moran by reason of insanity.&#xA;Opening the case for the prosecution, John O&#x2019;Kelly SC told the jury that when the indictment was read to Mr Smyth his response was not guilty by reason of insanity &#x201c;which is a plea that is open to a person under the Criminal Law Insanity Act.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;If such a defence is raised by an accused person, they are required to prove that defence to you,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;Mr O&#x2019;Kelly said the factual evidence of the case would not be disputed and the &#x201c;major factor in the case&#x201d; is whether or not Mr Smyth was suffering from a mental disorder at the time. He said that two consultant psychiatrists had prepared reports indicating Mr Smyth was suffering from a form of psychosis at the time.&#xA;Mr O&#x2019;Kelly told the court the evidence in this case will be that Mr Smyth attacked Ms Moran with a knife and stabbed her repeatedly. &#x201c;She died from a stab wound to her trunk through her heart,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;Late shift&#xA;Prosecution counsel told the court that on May 8th 2014 Ms Moran was working &#x201c;the late shift&#x201d; in the Holland and Barrett shop in the shopping centre. &#x201c;There was no one else in the shop at the time but people were around the shopping centre,&#x201d; said counsel.&#xA;The court heard Mr Smyth had known Ms Moran &#x201c;years earlier&#x201d; in their late teens when they went out together for a &#x201c;brief period of seven months&#x201d; after which they went their own ways.&#xA;Counsel said Ms Moran was away for some time and when she came back to the area, she started working in the Holland and Barrett store.&#xA;Counsel said the court will hear evidence that Mr Smyth had been diagnosed in 2005 as suffering from schizophrenia, and had treatment for a number of months at the time in a psychiatric hospital. Since then he had been &#x201c;back out in the community.&#x201d;&#xA;The court heard Ms Moran and Mr Smyth met very seldom over the period but in the months leading up to May 2014, Mr Smyth had become aware of where Ms Moran was working and had confronted her on a previous occasion.&#xA;&#x201c;He had in fact spat at her and this was disturbing for her, she was upset about it,&#x201d; said counsel.&#xA;At 8pm on the evening of May 8th 2014, counsel, said Mr Smyth came into the shop and started speaking to Ms Moran &#x201c;quite aggressively.&#x201d;&#xA;The court heard Ms Moran was in tears and a security man saw what was happening and spoke to Mr Smyth, asking him to leave.&#xA;Counsel said that &#x201c;within five minutes&#x201d; Mr Smyth was back in the shop again and &#x201c;this terrible attack took place.&#x201d;&#xA;Dragged outside&#xA;The court heard Ms Moran was &#x201c;stabbed repeatedly&#x201d; with a knife which Mr Smyth had brought to the scene. She was then dragged outside.&#xA;Mr Smyth was then disarmed and put sitting on the ground as people attended to Ms Moran who was &#x201c;very seriously injured.&#x201d;&#xA;Counsel said Mr Smyth then hopped up from the ground and &#x201c;ran out of the centre.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;He got a taxi to a cousin&#x2019;s house who lived on the outskirts of Kilkenny,&#x201d; said counsel.&#xA;Upon arrival at his cousin&#x2019;s house, Mr Smyth told his cousin he had stabbed &#x201c;his ex-girlfriend.&#x201d;&#xA;Gardaí were told where Mr Smyth was and he was later arrested.&#xA;The court also heard that Mr Smyth&#x2019;s mental illness had &#x201c;the effect that he would not have been able to refrain from doing what he did.&#x201d;&#xA;The trial continues.&#xA;"/>

Police and the justice system have been stretched to their limits. New laws won't fix the problem, but extra personnel could. By SPIEGEL Staff&#xA;Of course Tunisia could take back a few Tunisians. Germany would like to repatriate about 1,200 of the country's nationals, but the problems start with the fact that the Tunisian Embassy in Berlin isn't interested, has no time or has other reasons for why &quot;establishing contact with the embassy&quot; has been &quot;extremely difficult,&quot; as an official German government document reads.&#xA;Tunisia could, of course, easily identify its own citizens using their fingerprints, which would preclude mix-ups. But German officials can't seem to reach anybody. The result: Only six Tunisians were deported from Germany during the first six months of 2015.&#xA;Or Algeria. The Algerians have actually nothing against German inquiries as to whether they can send home one of the more than 2,000 Algerians who have been deemed subject to immediate deportation. But the reality is more complicated. Sometimes there are legal issues, sometimes humanitarian concerns and sometimes there are reasons that are impenetrable. In the end, only 24 were sent home.&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Total deportations from Germany between 2010 and 2015&#xA;And finally, Morocco. When the Germans present an expired passport at the Moroccan Embassy for one of the 2,300 Moroccans who have been ordered to leave, it first takes months before a new one is issued. Sometimes, apparently, it takes forever. Only 23 were sent home in the first half of last year. &quot;Repatriations to Morocco, and thus the enforcement of German law, are only possible on an extremely limited basis due to the uncooperative behavior of the embassy,&quot; the paper reads.&#xA;Has the German State Given Up?&#xA;Currently, several thousand people from the Maghreb region are slated for deportation from Germany, but they haven't had to leave because the state, in many respects, has become powerless to act. Not so long ago, it was just a figure that prompted shoulder-shrugging at most. That's how it is, it can't be changed, we have to live with it. But after the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Cologne , the numbers listed in the internal paper, which was compiled by German state governments, have a new significance. The impotence has remained, but the time for shrugging shoulders has passed. The state stands disgraced and trust is vanishing -- and not just when it comes to deportations, but when it comes to everything that a state actually stands for: internal security. Has the German state given up?&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Foreigners slated for deportation in Germany, by state&#xA;It is a painful diagnosis, and it goes far beyond the chaotic and horrific scenes in front of Cologne's main station on New Year's Eve. The state is suffering from a stress fracture: In key areas it has long been overwhelmed. It is an uncomfortable realization for the German people. The same state that records their lives right down to the smallest taxable detail and last year alone wrote or amended on the federal level around 8,000 paragraphs of law is now failing at its most basic tasks: protecting its citizens; law enforcement; security; public order.&#xA;There are financial reasons for the shortcoming: For decades, Germany has skimped on its civil service and cut budgets wherever possible. Now Berlin is paying the price. But the causes go much deeper than that, touching on the fundamental relationship between the German state and those who have recently arrived. In Germany, a 66-year-old democracy, the police have positioned themselves as &quot;friends and helpers,&quot; but it is a promise that young men from North Africa don't immediately understand.&#xA;It is the clash of two cultures: A constitutional state that emphasizes de-escalation, integration and the empathetic re-socialization of young offenders; and immigrants from authoritarian societies who misunderstand the approach and take advantage of the fact that they, even if they break the law, are neither deported nor toughly punished.&#xA;The consequence is that, in some places, law and order is restricted, or doesn't exist at all. Like in Cologne on New Year's Eve. Or in troubled city quarters in Frankfurt and Berlin during the entire year.&#xA;The state has accepted its own impotence, and it was perhaps possible to accept so long as tens of thousands of asylum-seekers weren't entering the country every year. But now Germany is facing an enormous task: that of absorbing and integrating hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of refugees. It is a challenge that can only be met if Germany once again begins to consistently enforce its rules.&#xA;Police Failures&#xA;A good place to start, particularly given the dark events in Cologne, is with the police. How is it possible that the square in front of the train station could morph into a zone of lawlessness? Why was the state not present on that New Year's Eve night? Was there a lack of police? Where they overwhelmed by the mob?&#xA;By Thursday of last week, some 650 criminal complaints stemming from New Year's Eve had been filed in Cologne, half of them for sexual assault, three of them for alleged rapes. In 103 cases, sexual assault and theft were combined.&#xA;Two weeks after the attacks, victims were still coming forward, most of them women, even if they are fully aware that their purses and mobile phones will most likely never be recovered. And that the men who sexually harassed or assaulted them will never be identified.&#xA;By late last week, state prosecutors had only identified 13 suspects: eight Moroccans, four Algerians and a Tunisian. Five of them are in pre-trial detention, accused of theft, receiving stolen goods and resisting arrest. Nobody by last Thursday had yet been detained for sexual assault. Some of the victims have told police they would be able to identify their assailant, but many others have said they could not.&#xA;The four public prosecutors and the additional 135 investigators belonging to the special investigations unit assembled to look into the New Year's crimes are doing what they can to collect evidence. Officials have collected underwear from many of the victims in the hope of finding DNA from the perpetrators, from sweat on their fingers, for example. Police are also hoping for leads acquaintances of the assailants. They have announced a reward of 10,000 for information leading to the culprits.&#xA;As one of the detective says, they are looking for &quot;a mass of perpetrators&quot; -- which means they will have to sift through a massive amount of data. That includes analyzing, with the help of software, more than 300 hours of footage from CCTV cameras mounted in, on and around the train station. One of their main discoveries so far, though, has been the fact that most of the cameras in the station don't work and that the others are outdated. An equipment renewal is scheduled for 2018.&#xA;Officials have also called on witnesses to upload videos from New Year's Eve to their website for analysis. But it seems unlikely that footage from the middle of a crowd on a dark night with bright fireworks going off will be much help.&#xA;What is slowly becoming clear, however, is why police failed to provide adequate security that night on the square between the main station and the Cologne Cathedral. Ralf Jäger, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, the state in which Cologne is located, believes much of the blame lies with the city's police department. He says officers failed to &quot;call for badly needed backup&quot; in time. They didn't even take advantage of backup that had been made available.&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Fear and facts about crime committed by immigrants&#xA;What Jäger doesn't mention is that those officers assigned to backup units, had they been called, would have needed at least two hours to respond. A report from Jäger's own ministry notes that the state police unit tasked with providing backup on New Year's Eve was already off duty by 6 p.m. After that, Jäger's ministry's strategy called for a trio of units, of 38 officers each, to be on call in case they were needed.&#xA;But they were spread out across the state. One unit was in Aachen, which is located 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Cologne, a second was in Gelsenkirchen (100 kilometers) and a third was in Wuppertal (50 kilometers). The officers would have needed an hour just to assemble at headquarters and another hour to get to the Cologne train station.&#xA;Not surprisingly, the police report from Cologne sounds rather different than the one from the NRW Interior Ministry. The police commander &quot;elected not to call for backup because, due to the time lag until they would be available on site, he did not view it as constructive.&quot; Experienced officers also said that even calling for help from neighboring police forces would have taken too long.&#xA;&quot;An impression developed that the state had lost the ability to take action for a few hours,&quot; North Rhine-Westphalia Governor Hannelore Kraft has admitted.&#xA;Unprepared for Terror?&#xA;For just a few hours? Only in Cologne? Those who work for the federal and state police forces are hardly surprised by the development. Largely unnoticed by the populace at large, German policymakers have spent the past few years reducing the size of the police forces while at the same time inundating them with new responsibilities. &quot;It was bound to happen sooner or later,&quot; says a police union official about the New Year's attacks. At some point, he continues, there is a price to pay when police forces have to spend just as much effort going after their budget-cutting goals as they do going after criminals.&#xA;According to GdP, one of two competing police unions in Germany, there were 237,198 state police officers in 2000, but today there are 10,000 fewer. Furthermore, all German states are faced with a mountain of overtime racked up by their officers -- some 18 million hours nationwide.&#xA;And it's not just police personnel that have been overworked. Equipment too is well beyond its wear limit, in many cases to the point that it has become dangerous. A classified Federal Interior Ministry report from Jan. 19, 2015 notes that German police would be unable to adequately protect themselves from gunfire from a Kalashnikov, the favored weapon of terrorists worldwide -- even in their response vehicles.&#xA;The report, completed shortly after the attack on the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, notes that the &quot;existing protective equipment (special vehicles and protective vests)&quot; available to state crisis response units &quot;does not offer any protection against firearms of the type Kalashnikov, which were used by the attackers in Paris.&quot;&#xA;German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière has frequently said that it is only a matter of time before a terror attack is committed on German soil. Yet the federal police force his ministry is in charge of is likewise inadequately equipped. &quot;With their current equipment,&quot; police officials admitted last summer, federal police emergency response units are &quot;only partially deployable in tough situations.&quot;&#xA;It is only when something actually happens that the fear of failure becomes great enough and action is taken. Once public attention wanes again, though, cuts and shortcuts continue as before. And hardly anyone cares.&#xA;Internal federal police documents clearly show what the back-and-forth looks like. In December 2012, the terror situation seemed relatively calm, as did that along the German-Austrian border. The Interior Ministry reported to German parliament that, &quot;since 2008, the number of officers has been reduced by 1,066, with 511 of those being prison officers.&quot; The period of increasing the security forces in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks in the US had passed and it was time to reduce the force.&#xA;But 2008 was also the year when Germany's federal police force was given a large new task. They took over control of Bavaria's southern border, with some 800 officers assigned to the duty. Prior to 2008, the Bavarian state police had controlled the border. Despite the new duties, the federal police force was not increased by a single officer.&#xA;Just a few years later, Federal Police Chief Dieter Romann applied for 3,000 new positions to be added to the 2013 budget. His request was not acted upon. In 2014, he again received nothing. Only in 2015 were new positions added to the force: 200 of them. But they were earmarked for the next new task assigned to the federal police force: that of guarding the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, in Frankfurt. And that is how the situation remained until the middle of 2015: the Interior Ministry continued to be stingy even as the refugee numbers had shot up and Islamists had staged the first attack in Paris.&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Suspected crimes by migrants&#xA;In February, Romann sat down again to document his needs for the 2016 budget. It reads like a call for help. Romann wrote of the federal police force facing a &quot;constant overload.&quot; He warned of the &quot;fatal consequences&quot; that could be linked to &quot;questions of political responsibility&quot; if, once again, nothing significant were to come of his requests. Then he demanded that the Interior Ministry grant him an extra 1,794 extra positions for 2016 and a total of 2,912 by 2019. Again, he failed, this time being rejected not by the Finance Ministry, but by his own boss in the Interior Ministry.&#xA;DER SPIEGEL&#xA;Suspected migrant criminals, by nationality&#xA;Interior Minister de Maizière only wanted to push for an additional 526 positions in the 2016 budget negotiations. &quot;For years, we have been saved to death so that Germany could balance its budget. Minister de Maizière was blind and deaf to the condition of the federal police force,&quot; says deputy union head Jörg Radek. In the end, it wasn't de Maizière, but the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, that threw its support behind Romann in the federal budget negotiations. &quot;I will do that as head of the Social Democrats, since the Interior Ministry apparently isn't demanding anything,&quot; wrote Sigmar Gabriel to a confidant shortly before the decisive round of negotiations. Gabriel is also minister of the economy and, as head of Merkel's junior coalition partner, vice chancellor.&#xA;The federal budget ultimately approved the additional 3,000 positions that have been requested for years and included them in the 2016 budget -- 1,000 per year until 2019. But the first new officers will only join their units in 2019, after training.&#xA;'Total Failure of State Power'&#xA;The consequences of the years of belt-tightening can now be observed on the Bavarian border, where during the summer and fall, the federal police took on a number of new refugee-related tasks that have little to do with actual policing: distributing meals, assembling groups for bus transfers, and organizing transportation to identification centers and initial reception facilities.&#xA;This winter, the situation has improved only on the surface. &quot;What is happening down here in Passau is insane,&quot; says a frustrated federal police officer, saying it reminds him of a never-ending Ping-Pong game. Austria sends refugees to Bavaria and then, in a more recent development, Germany sends many of them back to Austria -- those with no papers or those who don't want to remain in Germany but want to continue onward to Sweden, for example. Not 24 hours later, the same people are back in Passau, essentially becoming the victims of a power struggle between Austria and Germany. &quot;It's a total failure of state power,&quot; says one of the police officers.&#xA;The federal police are required to report each case indicating that the person in question crossed the border illegally -- even if the offender crossed the border on a state-chartered bus. Some 1,000 such reports have thus far been filed. It is little more than bureaucratic waste, sent along to the appropriate public prosecutors office so that the case can then be immediately thrown out.&#xA;The trail of overwork and fatigue leads across the entire country, from the federal police on the border to the state prosecutors and the officials in each German state. None of them were even remotely prepared for the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees. State bureaucrats, who had spent their days writing regulations pertaining to the correct number of bicycle racks for newly built residential housing where suddenly being asked to improvise and find shelter for 1,000 newly arrived refugees per week. At the same time, others were tasked with guaranteeing public safety.&#xA;Eroding Trust&#xA;Not surprisingly, they were not always successful -- and trust in the state began to erode ever more rapidly.&#xA;The city of Braunschweig provides a telling example. At times last year, more than 4,000 people were housed at a former barracks at the edge of town, many of them in the buildings but also in tents and containers outside. As the number of newcomers to the initial reception facility rose, so too did the number of crimes committed nearby. Much of it was petty theft, but there were also break-ins, fights and different forms of harassment -- and locals were unsettled. Still, there were very few convictions. The reason was that summons to police or judicial interrogations could not be delivered because suspects had long-since disappeared or registered elsewhere under a different name. &quot;They laugh at us because nothing happens to them,&quot; says one detective.&#xA;In August 2015, the Braunschweig police department became the first in the country to establish a special unit for the express purpose of investigating crimes committed by refugees. Police Chief Cordula Müller made the decision to begin locking up suspects in pre-trial detention for a week even for minor crimes. &quot;Criminals have to understand that Germany has laws that they must obey,&quot; she says. It worked because the judiciary in Braunschweig went along with the plan. Accelerated hearings have become just as important as rapid investigations and cases are now heard immediately instead of months later.&#xA;Since it was founded, the special unit has dealt with around 1,300 cases. One of the detectives recalls a judge delivering a clear message during one of the very first hearings. &quot;You are bringing other asylum-seekers into disrepute,&quot; he told the defendant. It is the kind of thing that Cordula Müller likes to hear. &quot;We don't have a problem with refugees. We have a problem with criminals,&quot; she says.&#xA;In the public debate, that kind of nuance was not always easy to find in recent months. Initially, newcomers were welcomed with flowers and applause at Munich's central train station. Not long later, they were pitied as victims of right-wing rhetoric and violence. More recently, though, the discussion has focused on limits. And since New Year's, even the federal justice minister has spoken of &quot;uninhibited hordes&quot; and a &quot;temporary break with civilization.&quot;&#xA;Losing Control&#xA;But as fast as opinions have changed, the state and its institutions have reacted at a snail's pace. Its loss of control is a gradual process, and much more difficult to observe.&#xA;That can also be seen in the question as to how the flow of refugees should be registered and distributed. The numbers reported by the federal government sound precise and consistent with German thoroughness. In truth, though, they are at best extremely approximate. Last year, up to 10,000 newcomers each day had to be sheltered and fed. It is understandable that officials were overwhelmed. But the lack of accurate statistics is also the product of the fact that almost every German state has its own solution when it comes to registering and distributing new arrivals.&#xA;A national registration system does exist called &quot;Easy.&quot; It says that a total of 1,091,894 asylum-seekers entered the country in 2015, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) reported two weeks ago. But that doesn't necessarily mean that close to 1.1 million refugees have actually entered Germany. Experts believe the real figure could be tens, or even hundreds of thousands, lower because it is easy for registrations to be duplicated within the system.&#xA;&quot;Easy&quot; is the German abbreviation for Primary Distribution of Asylum-Seekers and it was designed exclusively to help spread the refugees out among the 16 federal states according to quotas set by the German government. New arrivals don't even have to provide a name under the system. They only have to state their country of origin and their familial connection to other refugees.&#xA;Many new arrivals are simply waved into Germany by border officials without even taking any personal data. It often takes days after they enter into the country before they first come into contact with &quot;Easy,&quot; often in a refugee camp. In some cases, asylum-seekers are given temporary ID cards for the camps that include the name they provided. In others, they are just given colored wristbands that give them access to food and services.&#xA;In many places, refugees simply disappear soon after arrival, without anyone knowing where they've gone. The operators of some asylum-seeker camps, like one in the state of Hesse outside of Frankfurt, report a disappearance rate among refugees as high as 50 percent within the first two days after arrival.&#xA;The states are attempting to limit these fluctuations by taking steps to personally register refugees at an earlier stage. But even that isn't helping much because it is being conducted according to disparate standards and using different software programs. For example, some states are taking fingerprints, but others are not. Generally, an automated exchange of data between the states is not currently possible, and neither is it possible to match data up with that of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), with the national asylum-seeker register maintained by the federal refugee office BAMF or the Europe-wide Eurodac refugee database.&#xA;Opportunities for Fraud&#xA;Those determined to do so, can thus secure duplicate social benefits, such as the 143 a month in pocket money, from the government without getting caught simply by registering in different states using either the same or different names. During each registration, the authorities issue a &quot;Certificate of Registration as an Asylum-Seeker.&quot; The simple paper is intended to serve as a kind of emergency identity card for the refugees, a temporary solution until they are able to get an appointment with BAMF to submit their official asylum application. Right now, it often takes months for that to happen.&#xA;Given the chaotic procedures that are currently in place, criminals can simply secure official papers for multiple identities. The suspected Islamist from an asylum-seekers' hostel in Recklinghausen, Germany, who attacked police in Paris with an axe at the beginning of January on the first anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attack is believed to have registered with the authorities using at least seven different names.&#xA;An investigation by the BKA also found that the man had applied for asylum in Switzerland and Romania. Europe's Eurodac fingerprint database is intended to prevent this kind of situation. &quot;We need to review whether the system failed,&quot; says one official.&#xA;Officials have been aware of the registration problems for some time now, but the federal government didn't present a draft law that would require all refugees to be fingerprinted and photographed in a nationwide system until December. Once they have been registered, they are to be provided with a unified &quot;proof of arrival&quot; ID that is standardized and at least halfway unforgeable. The system is supposed to go into place in mid-February, but it will still take some time before it is implemented at all the initial reception centers in the individual states. Interior Minister de Maizière says he is hopeful it can be completed by mid-2016.&#xA;Complicated Deportations&#xA;But even more difficult than registering new refugees is the deportation of rejected asylum-seekers or immigrant criminal offenders. Even as the government has announced its intention to make such deportations easier, the situation is unlikely to change much. For years, German officials have been complaining about 28 &quot;problem countries&quot; that continually refuse to allow the return of their citizens facing deportation from Germany despite their obligation to do so under international law. They include the Maghreb states like Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, which have shown little willingness to cooperate, especially in cases where those slated for deportation are known criminals.&#xA;When German authorities, for example, notify the Moroccan Embassy about a candidate for deportation, officials say they often get answers like, &quot;We can't find that person in our database.&quot; Or they will point to alleged humanitarian reasons for making the return trip unacceptable. One German government document states that around 5,500 Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians were &quot;subject to deportation&quot; as of the end of July, but officials only managed to deport 53 nationals from those countries during the first half of 2015.&#xA;In recent months, officials in Berlin have complained repeatedly to officials in the Maghreb countries. In a joint letter, de Maizière and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), recently demanded greater cooperation from their counterparts in those countries when it comes to repatriation. As of last week, they still hadn't received a response. The German government has so far avoided acting on the threat of cutting development aid to the countries if they don't cooperate, but the warnings are there. Over the weekend, deputy chancellor and SPD boss Sigmar Gabriel admonished the Maghreb states and threatened that future funding may be tied to cooperation on deportations.&#xA;The consequences of not being able to deport have become apparent in places like Cologne. Or in the state of Saxony. An Interior Ministry report from the end of 2015 notes that a quarter of all foreigners suspected of committing crimes in the state were Tunisians, despite the fact that they comprise only 4 percent of all immigrants in the state. So far, authorities haven only succeeded in deporting very few. After months of pressure, the Tunisian Embassy recently sent the German government a list of 170 nationals the country would possibly be willing to take back -- a token gesture of goodwill.&#xA;Still, it is anything but certain that the 170 Tunisians will actually leave Germany. For years, the German government permitted a situation in which those who behaved the most brazenly were able to prevent their deportation. Those who concealed their true identity, went underground at the right moment, got a doctor's note saying they were incapable of flying or caused such a ruckus in the deportation aircraft that the pilot refused to take off, often succeeded in staying in Germany.&#xA;Little Respect for Justice&#xA;Indeed, these individuals have felt very little of the &quot;heavy hand of the law&quot; now being called for by German politicians, Chancellor Merkel first and foremost. The same applies to young offenders facing the justice system for the first time.&#xA;Michael Brennecke has been a public defender in the town of Achim in Lower Saxony for almost 30 years. Based on his experience with numerous cases, he believes that educational measures applied by juvenile courts against young immigrant pickpockets seldom have much impact. He says people who come from countries where conviction for theft means getting your hand cut off &quot;have a totally different understanding of our legal system -- they don't take our sentences seriously.&quot;&#xA;Brennecke often represents delinquent refugee youth. He says there's a typical sentencing pattern. &quot;The case involving a first offense will be closed, then comes a first hearing and a second hearing, both of which end with fines. After another infraction, he is subject to a juvenile arrest. If another crime is committed, the youth gets sentenced to jail time, which is then converted to probation. And? To them it's easy peasy. They march out of the courtroom and flash the victory sign to their friends.&quot; Brennecke says he's represented defendants who have been prosecuted 15 or 16 times without ever being put at any serious disadvantage.&#xA;Johann Krieten, a juvenile court judge in Hamburg has developed his own method of ensuring an environment of respect. In his courtroom, he orders people to take off their hats, spit out their gum, sit up straight and keep quiet. Anyone who doesn't obey his rules is fined. Those who don't pay are then held in contempt of court custody.&#xA;When he asks where the defendants are from, Krieten is likewise not easily satisfied. He'll often ask a question about a mountain in the country they live in or a famous football player and can tell very quickly if he's being lied to or not. Sometimes the interpreters also provide solid clues about the defendant's true origins. &quot;In any case, I have never had the feeling that I was not being taken seriously,&quot; Krieten says.&#xA;Does Germany Need to Get Tougher?&#xA;So does the German justice system need to find new language in order to better reach foreign offenders? Are tougher sentences necessary in order to put a lid on criminality on the part of young Moroccans and Tunisians?&#xA;Not according to Krieten. He still believes resocialization measures can be better than prison terms, even for young migrants. He points to youth welfare facilities that include limited detainment, as an example. There, young men are provided with intense guidance and supervision, far away from their old friends when possible. The judge says that one of the major problems is that he often only encounters juvenile delinquents very late in the process. Public prosecutors end many investigations due to insignificance -- in many instances as a result of a lack of staff needed to deal with the cases. This can leave young foreign offenders feeling that the state accepts their behavior.&#xA;Krieten argues that the justice system must do the opposite. It needs to make its presence felt and engage with young men who often have a problem with self-determined women and, as a last resort, know only the kind of violence they may have learned from their own families. &quot;Instead of perpetuating the illusion that you can just deport them all,&quot; Krieten says, &quot;the truth is that we must solve the problems here.&quot;&#xA;Better Enforcement Needed, Not New Laws&#xA;Regardless whether in Hamburg, Braunschweig or Cologne, the problems with criminal immigrants in Germany's major cities didn't just pop up overnight on New Year's Eve. And they cannot be solved with the kind of prescriptions given by the government after every crisis: tightening laws and issuing new regulations.&#xA;What is more important is the consistent application of the laws already on the books. This would require a stronger police presence and hiring more staff in the government agencies in question. It would also require more money. In short: The state has to become more active and creative in order to put a lid on these problems and regain full control over the country.&#xA;Elke Bartels, the chief of police in Duisburg, a German city with a population of close to half a million, has already tested how that might be done. During the summer, a district in the northern part of the city dominated by foreign clans threatened to spiral out of control. Even during the most trivial of police deployments, officers at times found themselves quickly surrounded by large crowds -- with the occasional exchange of blows and threats. During one drug inspection, for example, a female police officer and her colleague were beaten to the ground. They had to draw their weapons and call for reinforcements in order to escape the situation.&#xA;&quot;We had to prevent a lawless place from taking shape here,&quot; explains Bartels. &quot;The state's monopoly on the use of force can only be enforced with a zero-tolerance strategy.&quot; She urgently requested funding for additional personnel from the North Rhine-Westphalia state Interior Ministry in Düsseldorf. She didn't get the hundreds she was hoping for, but 30 new police officers did report for work on July 17.&#xA;From that point on, they began investigating every single violation of the law and each breach of public order in the problem areas, from people using their mobile phones while driving to trash thrown away illegally to disturbing the peace. Since then, police have issued close to 4,000 fines and taken 75 people into temporary custody.&#xA;&quot;We have recaptured respect,&quot; Bartels says.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

This is his story." content="Self Immolation Survivor Looks Back at Arab Spring&#xA;'I Wish I Could Die': Meeting the Man Who Helped Trigger the Arab Spring&#xA;By Clemens Höges in Kasserine, Tunisia&#xA;Clemens Höges/ DER SPIEGEL&#xA;The Arab Spring began five years ago when two men set themselves on fire in Tunisia. One of them survived his self-immolation -- and now wishes he hadn't. This is his story.&#xA;Hosni Kaliya pulls a cigarette out of his pack with his mouth. When he poured gasoline on his body and set himself on fire, most of his right hand was consumed by the flames and all that remains is a stump without fingers. He still has four fingers on his left hand, but they jut out like claws, burned, stiff and contorted. His fingernails are curled. He wears black wool gloves with the fingertips cut off, so that they won't dangle emptily. A knit cap protects Kaliya's head, where his hair was burned off, and his unusually small ears. But the disfigured face, the work of doctors using old and new skin, how could he hide that?&#xA;Kaliya needs medication to sleep. Should his head fall backwards, he could be strangled by the skin on his neck, because it's stretched too tightly across his larynx. He shouldn't smoke, because the flames and soot severely damaged his lungs and trachea. But he does so nonetheless, as if he were trying to destroy what he has turned into: this figure that instills fear in children, a prisoner in his own body. &quot;I wish I could die,&quot; says Kaliya.&#xA;Everything burns, inside and out. Everything hurts, his body and his soul, because he blames himself: for the destruction of his family, for the death of his brother and several friends, and yes, he even blames himself a little for the Arab Spring, the uprising that began in Tunisia five years ago and has since turned into a tragedy. Two men triggered the Arab Spring. The world remembers one of them, the fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi. The other was Hosni Kaliya.&#xA;The acts of desperation quickly transformed into a political hurricane. It swept along Africa's Mediterranean coast and up to the Turkish border. Dictators were overthrown, new rulers came to power and Islamists and terrorists spread across the region. Countries collapsed and hundreds of thousands died, and are still dying, in civil wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen. The offshoots of this storm have also reached Europe, in the form of mass immigration and terrorist attacks in Paris and Istanbul.&#xA;And what for? &quot;It was all a mistake,&quot; says Kaliya. &quot;I didn't know what would happen. I no longer believe in the revolution.&quot;&#xA;To understand how it all began and why it's a long way from being over, it helps to return to one of the starting points of this hurricane: Kaliya's home town of Kasserine, more than three-hours by car southwest of Tunis. It is a town in the barren highlands of Tunisia and it feels much farther away than it already is -- almost as if it were on another planet. Kasserine is at the foot of Jebel Chaambi, the highest mountain in Tunisia. Terrorists are now hiding in the surrounding canyons, and every few weeks the army attacks them with artillery and helicopters. The coast has always been where the money is made and where investment goes. Former dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali allowed the hinterlands around Kasserine to become impoverished.&#xA;A Modicum of Dignity&#xA;Kaliya normally lives in a home in Tunis, but I met with him and his mother Zhina at her home on a grimy street in Kasserine. His mother is a tiny woman and far too weak to care for a heavy, 42-year-old man who is unable to dress himself. Zhina tries to turn on an old space heater for Kaliya, whose joints stiffen and hands hurt when it gets cold. But his head is clear as he talks about how it all began, five years ago.&#xA;There was unrest in the region surrounding Kasserine in the last few days of 2010. On Dec. 17, fruit vendor Bouazizi had set himself on fire in nearby Sidi Bouzid after being harassed by the authorities. People immediately took to the streets, initially to protest against government tyranny and then against the Tunisian dictator and the extravagant lifestyle of his extended family -- and against high youth unemployment and rising bread and vegetable prices. The protesters wanted freedom and a modicum of dignity.&#xA;Kaliya, who was working as a hotel doorman in the beach resort town of Sousse at the time, took a few days off and drove home to Kasserine to see his family and friends. He earned good money at the beach resort, and he liked to show off. He told his friends that they should make something of themselves, and that they should leave Kasserine, where life had come to a standstill and seemed directionless.&#xA;Like many others, Kaliya also talked about the need to sweep away the regime. But he was no revolutionary, and he had no thoughts or ideas about overthrowing the government, and certainly no plan. All he had was a hatred of the regime.&#xA;On Jan. 3, he was stopped by the police, who asked to see his identification papers. &quot;I had money in my pockets and I was good looking,&quot; says Kaliya. Perhaps it was his expensive boots, or perhaps the way he walked, the swagger of a doorman, a kick-boxer, that the policemen didn't like. It was certainly the big ring a Frenchman had given him in Sousse, the ring with the big cross on it. When he saw the ring, says Kaliya, one of the policemen said to him: &quot;Do you know why we're here? To fuck guys like you.&quot;&#xA;A Mistake in a Dictatorship&#xA;And then, according to Kaliya, the policeman slammed his fist into Kaliya's stomach. He vomited and fell to the ground, where he lay in his vomit as the policemen laughed. He filed a complaint at the police station the next day -- a mistake in a dictatorship. Or an act of rebellion.&#xA;Three days later, Kaliya saw the same police officer as he was walking past the bus station. The cop mentioned Kaliya's complaint, and then started beating him with his baton, hitting his face and hands, Kaliya recalls.&#xA;This time Kaliya fought back. It was his second mistake. Other officers appeared immediately and seriously roughed him up. In the end, they also emptied a canister of tear gas into his face. &quot;When they left me lying there, I felt like an insect that they had stepped on.&quot;&#xA;He pulled himself together and staggered to one of the many illegal gas stations that are equipped with just a barrel and a hand pump. Smugglers use them to sell cheap gasoline from Algeria. Kaliya took a bottle of gasoline and went back to the bus station. &quot;I wasn't myself anymore, and I didn't know what I was doing.&quot; He didn't want to be a hero and he wasn't sending a political message. He simply could no longer bear the humiliation.&#xA;For a moment, says Kaliya, he thought he could light the bottle on fire and throw it at the police officers. &quot;But I didn't have a chance. There were too many of them, and they were armed.&quot; Instead, he lifted the bottle over his head, turned it upside-down and allowed the gasoline to run over his body. Then he pulled out his lighter.&#xA;He remembers hearing the sound of burning fat, a hissing sound, like drops of grease falling from a barbecue grill into the hot coals. He staggered toward the policemen, but everything went black after that. The news of what he had done spread quickly in Kasserine.&#xA;'Nothing But Criminals'&#xA;&quot;We all thought that Hosni Kaliya was dead,&quot; says Ali Rebah, one of the young intellectuals of Kasserine. He went to the family's home, where others had already gathered. That night, car tires were set on fire in the streets of Kasserine.&#xA;Rebah, a sound engineer, also wanted to do something, as best he could. &quot;The government media characterized all the demonstrators as nothing but criminals. So we needed something of our own: independent information. No one was being told what was happening here.&quot; On the same day, he used an Internet streaming service and Facebook to spread the news of Kaliya's self-immolation.&#xA;The violence escalated over the next three days. Protestors threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. The special government units that were brought in aimed at the head and the heart, killing more than 20 demonstrators and injuring dozens. It was the first massacre of the Arab spring. And Rebah was one of those who ensured that the world learned about what had happened.&#xA;Kaliya wasn't aware of any of this: He was in a coma in the burn unit of a Tunis hospital. Mohamed Bouazizi had died in the same hospital three days before Kaliya's self-immolation, and others apparently tried to set themselves on fire during the same period. Dictator Zine El Abidin Ben Ali visited Bouazizi at his hospital bed. He had tried to soften his tone, spoke of an end to the violence and promised hundreds of thousands of jobs for young people. But it was too late. A week after Kaliya set himself on fire, the dictator fled the country.&#xA;The spark of revolution immediately jumped to other countries in the region. The uprising against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak began on Jan. 25, 2011, Yemenis rebelled against President Ali Abdullah Saleh a few days later, in mid-February the Libyans revolted against Moammar Gadhafi, and in March the Syrians began their revolution against President Bashar Assad.&#xA;During this period, Kaliya was operated on multiple times. Skin was transplanted from one part of his body to another, and his throat was reconstructed. A few times, doctors had to resuscitate him. Kaliya recounts a nightmare he believes he had at the time. In the dream, he was walking along a street when the buildings suddenly flew toward him and crushed his body.&#xA;A Stalemate&#xA;He only regained consciousness after eight months. At first he could only hear muffled sounds, because he was wrapped in bandages, like a mummy. His eyes were also bandaged. He didn't know where he was, and he had forgotten who he was. Then the doctors removed the bandages from his eyes.&#xA;A short time later, Tunisia held its first free and democratic election. When the Islamist Ennahda Movement won the vote, many liberal Tunisians felt it was a disaster. Still, the Islamists were unable to govern alone but were instead forced to share power with two other parties. An Islamist served as prime minister, but human rights activist Moncef Marzouki became the country's president.&#xA;It was a stalemate, and the country was soon on the brink of emergency rule. The Islamists wanted to enshrine Sharia law in the constitution and limit the rights of women. They did not prevail, but then Salafists engaged in street battles with the police and tens of thousands demonstrated against the Islamists, in part due to rising unemployment. Protestors also accused Ennahda of supporting Ansar al-Sharia, a Salafist terrorist organization.&#xA;For Kaliya, these events were far away. His mother Zhina, who had only been allowed to look at her son through a window for many months due to the risk of infection, told him about everything that was happening in the world. She also told him about friends and relatives. Eleven had died in the uprising. A psychologist also went to see him every day. She told him his name, and she spoke with him about Kasserine, the policemen and the gasoline.&#xA;As Kaliya slowly regained his memory, he began to understand the enormity of the storm he and the fruit vendor had triggered.&#xA;Still, President Marzouki ensured that those who were wounded in the revolution were properly looked after. Kaliya's mother was given an apartment in the capital, so that she could care for her son.&#xA;'Not Accustomed to Freedom'&#xA;In the summer of 2013, Tunisia was on the brink of civil war. Two opposition politicians had been murdered, probably by Islamists, and Ennahda feared a military coup like the one that had occurred in Egypt. At that moment, an unusual quartet of four organizations, led by a federation of trade unions, intervened to mediate between the opposing groups. Ennahda agreed to a transitional government and new elections, and the quartet was last year awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts.&#xA;But the party that won the new election, in October 2014, was Nidaa Tounes, which included many of Ben Ali's former cohorts. Béji Caïd Essebsi, 89, a former interior minister in the Ben Ali dictatorship, became president and made his son the party's deputy leader. For many Tunisians, this marked the beginning of a new political dynasty. Is the country back where it was when he, Hosni Kaliya, set himself on fire?&#xA;&quot;We were hopeful, but we Tunisians are not accustomed to freedom,&quot; says Kaliya.&#xA;Surviving heroes can become a burden when they criticize the heirs of a revolution. Under the new regime, Kaliya was shunted off to a home for unwed mothers and he has been waiting for several urgent operations for months. The surgeries must be approved by a committee, but the committee is dragging its feet. &quot;They are letting me rot in this home,&quot; says Kaliya. He feels like a phantom, someone the government doesn't want anyone to see or hear.&#xA;He cannot return to Kasserine, because the only doctors that can help him in an emergency are in Tunis. He occasionally visits his friends and his mother in Kasserine. When he looks around today, he says, he sees nothing to suggest that it was all worthwhile.&#xA;&quot;There was no Arab spring,&quot; says Kaliya. Various factions are fighting each other in Libya, while the self-proclaimed Islamic State captures town after town. In Egypt, former General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi rules in much the same way as Mubarak did. Saudi Arabia is bombarding Yemen, where Shiite and Sunni militias are at war. And then there is Syria, where more than 250,000 have died. Is it presumptuous to accept the blame?&#xA;A Hotbed of Jihad&#xA;Tunisia, of course, is in better shape and is still viewed as a shimmer of hope in the Arab disaster. At least Tunisians cast their ballots instead of shooting at each other. But the peace is fragile. There is high unemployment, especially among young people, and several thousand Tunisians are fighting for Islamic State in Syria, Iraq and Libya.&#xA;Or they are carrying out attacks at home. Last March, Islamist militants murdered 20 tourists at the national museum in Tunis. In June, a gunman killed 38 tourists at a beach resort hotel in Sousse . Terror groups aligned with Islamic State claimed responsibility for both attacks. Finally, two months ago, a suicide bomber blew up a bus carrying presidential guards in Tunis, killing 13 soldiers. The series of attacks has all but destroyed the tourist industry, a significant source of revenue for Tunisia.&#xA;Kasserine and the canyons of Jebel Chaambi are now considered a hotbed of jihad, an unsafe area that is said to be prime recruitment territory for terrorists. &quot;Terror emerges in places where people are marginalized,&quot; says economist Hizi Med Raouf. He returned to his hometown of Kasserine from Tunis a few months after the uprising began.&#xA;Raouf believed that everything would change, and that entrepreneurs would create new businesses now that the dictatorship was gone and he rented a small office on the main street of Kasserine. In Los Angeles or Berlin, his company would be referred to as a start-up incubator. He advises prospective entrepreneurs, prepares feasibility studies and facilitates business relationships. But he constantly encounters the old networks from the Ben Ali-era in banks and government agencies, men with little interest in change.&#xA;Raouf has studied the numbers. Half of the educated young people in Kasserine are unemployed, he says, while smuggling is -- just as it has always been -- the most important business in the region due to the proximity of the border with Algeria. &quot;I'm an optimist, or else I couldn't do what I do. Even if nothing is working, I want to keep believing that everything will improve.&quot;&#xA;Nothing Better to Do&#xA;A few buildings down the street from Raouf's office, Ali Rebah runs the radio station that he started on the Internet on the day Kaliya set himself on fire. The station, KFM, has grown and now has 70 employees and transmits its programs to a region with a population of 400,000 people. But none of the people who work for KFM is paid a single dinar, including Rebah, because the small amount of advertising revenue only covers operating costs. Besides, says Rebah, most of his people are unemployed anyway and have nothing better to do.&#xA;&quot;Anyone can speak his mind in Tunisia now. Aside from that, not much has changed,&quot; says Rebah. &quot;We need more time. Much more time.&quot; That's why KFM works together with schools. Children help produce radio programs and, in the process, learn how elections work, that different opinions count and, most of all, that it is possible to bring about change. Rebah is pinning his hopes on the next generation. He no longer believes that change will happen quickly, and probably not for his generation, the one that triggered the Arab spring in the first place.&#xA;But not everyone is as patient. Hosni Kaliya had a younger brother, Saber. He was 35 and worked as a custodian. He made a decent living and even managed to support his mother. But Saber lost his job last summer. Many in Kasserine are losing their jobs, because businesses are going under or shifting production to the coast, and because new projects have become bogged down, and because the revolution, which Hosni Kaliya helped trigger, brought democracy but no jobs.&#xA;Saber fought for his job, spending three months begging his employer not to let him go. He had no other job prospects. When he felt that there was no longer any hope, he bought himself a bottle of gasoline, just as his brother had done, and set himself on fire, not far from his home. When his mother heard the screams, she ran out of the house and saw Saber lying on the ground, engulfed in flames. He died on Oct. 14.&#xA;&quot;I curse this revolution. I want my sons back,&quot; says the mother, weeping into a piece of cloth, already wet and dark from her tears. &quot;More will die, more will fight and more will set themselves on fire. They have no future.&quot;&#xA;Hosni Kaliya sits quietly next to her. He wasn't even able to weep properly at his brother's funeral, because the flames destroyed his right tear duct.&#xA;Translated from the German by Christopher Sultan&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

Prominent feminist Anne Wizorek disagrees. SPIEGEL brought them together for a joint interview.&#xA;Alice Schwarzer, 73, the grande dame of German feminism, and Anne Wizorek, 34, a prominent member of the new generation of feminists, often have different views about the direction the women's movement should take. For decades, Schwarzer -- as publisher of Emma, the country's highly influential women's magazine -- has been at the forefront of women's issues. In more recent years, a younger generation of feminists, led by Wizorek, has sought to challenge Schwarzer's preeminence.&#xA;Wizorek herself gained prominence in early 2013 when she launched the hashtag # aufschrei , or outcry, along with a fresh debate highlighting everyday sexism suffered by women in Germany and elsewhere.&#xA;Both women are concerned about recent developments in Cologne that saw mass sexual violence against women perpetrated by Muslim immigrants . The following is an excerpt from a combative interview with SPIEGEL in which the two share their at times divergent views on the violence and the consequences.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Ms. Schwarzer, Ms. Wizorek, what happened in Cologne on New Year's Eve? Was it a particularly extreme example of sexism or the consequence of failed immigration policies?&#xA;Wizorek: The events were terrible and, given the scale, a new phenomenon. That's why we need to take a very precise look at what happened. I really hope that the perpetrators are caught. The ensuing debate, though, unfortunately has had the wrong focus: It is wrong to only speak about sexualized violence if it is committed by migrants or refugees.&#xA;Schwarzer: The debate over sexual violence has re-emerged as a result of that night in Cologne. Even Germany's justice minister, who for years allowed necessary reforms to tighten Germany's rape laws torot in a drawer, has pulled them out again. But when you only speak using generalizations, you run the danger of denying the specific. In recent decades, millions of people have come to us from cultural groups within which women have absolutely no rights. They do not have a voice of their own and they are totally dependent on their fathers, brothers or husbands. That applies to North Africa and that applies to large parts of the Middle East. It isn't always linked to Islam. But since the end of the 1970s, at the beginning of the revolution in Iran under Khomenei, we have experienced a politicization of Islam. From the beginning, it had a primary adversary: the emancipation of women. With more men now coming to us from this cultural sphere, and some additionally brutalized by civil wars, this is a problem. We cannot simply ignore it.&#xA;Wizorek: But it is also wrong to look only at the origin of the perpetrators. When I see the kinds of people that are now jumping into the debate over women's rights, it also includes, among others, the same politicians who, during the #aufschrei debate in 2013, said that women shouldn't be so demanding. Now that men with immigration backgrounds have committed sexual assaults, it is being instrumentalized in order to stigmatize them as a group. I think that is racist.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Do you consider Ms. Schwarzer to be a racist?&#xA;Wizorek: It is racist to act as though it is only immigrant men who (commit sexual assault). I would really like to see a more nuanced debate about sexual violence. Such violence is a problem for all of society, for all genders, and it cannot be allowed to become the standard in gender debates that only male migrants are considered to be those responsible.&#xA;Schwarzer: It is always the right move to take a closer look. Of course we in Europe also have epidemic, structural sexual violence. Violence is always the dark core of dominance. The men who are now coming to us from Islamic cultural circles are, of course, shaped by conditions there, which are still much more antiquated than here. That's a problem that we have ignored for far too long. In the name of a false tolerance, we have accepted that women are kept at home like prisoners and are forcibly married.&#xA;Wizorek: But now we have reached the core of the issue. We have to engage an integration debate, not an exclusionary debate.&#xA;Schwarzer: But who's leading an exclusionary debate?&#xA;Wizorek: The majority society in Germany.&#xA;Schwarzer: I'd like to tell you something about majority society. Majority society has really been taken for a ride over the past 25 years. There was and there is a growing uneasiness within majority society as a result of this false tolerance. Parallel societies have emerged. A young woman can no longer go through certain neighborhoods without one of the young men shouting, &quot;You slut!&quot; Friends of mine who live in Kreuzberg (eds. note: a neighborhood in Berlin with a large Muslim population) have told me about it.&#xA;Wizorek: I live in Berlin and I have never heard that in Kreuzberg.&#xA;Schwarzer: Then you've been lucky. But if we keep denying that there are problems with some male immigrants, then we will just drive the people into the arms of the right-wing populists. Without the ignorance or the trivialization on the part of all the political parties, there would be no Pegida (eds. note: a xenophobic movement based in Dresden) or Alternative for Germany (eds. note: a new, and growing right-wing populist party in Germany).&#xA;Wizorek: I am not denying that the patriarchal structures are stronger in some countries than in Germany. But the core of the problem is not Islam, it is patriarchy.&#xA;Schwarzer: Now you too are starting to interpret the Koran. I have to tell you: I think that's pointless and I've never indulged in it myself. If I read the Bible, I can also find a few harsh verdicts. Every religion can be abused. We're not talking here about religion and faith. We are talking about the politicization of Islam, and, by the way, it is first and foremost exerting pressure on the majority of peaceful Muslims who live here in Germany.&#xA;SPIEGEL: If this isn't about origins, then how would you explain what happened in Cologne, Ms. Wizorek?&#xA;Wizorek: Since it is still unclear whether this was an organized crime, I can't give a conclusive assessment. In principle, though, attacks in groups are no new phenomenon. When large groups of men come together and alcohol is involved, women are often the subject of harassment. That happens in football stadiums, during Karneval in Cologne or at Oktoberfest in Munich. I am against focusing on just this group of perpetrators just because of their origins.&#xA;DPA&#xA;Protesters stand in front of the Cologne central station, where sexual attacks were perpetrated on a broad scale on New Year's Eve. The sign reads, &quot;No means no! That's our law. Stay away from our bodies!&quot;&#xA;Schwarzer: Do you know what I just thought of, Anne? You were born in East Germany at the beginning of the 1980s, right?&#xA;Wizorek: Yes.&#xA;Schwarzer: It's entirely OK that you missed certain things. In the 1960s and 1970s among the leftests in the West, one of the leading arguments against feminism was that it was only a subordinate issue. That's what people said back then. The main issue was the class struggle.&#xA;Wizorek: I am familiar with the discussion.&#xA;Schwarzer: As soon as you opened your mouth and said the word woman, you were beaten down with the argument that you were betraying the class struggle. There are many poignant writings in which feminists first write pages about their class standpoint before getting to their actual issue. What was then known as class warfare is today called anti-racism. The threat of being accused of racism gave birth to false tolerance. Once, about 20 years ago, a police officer in Cologne told me, &quot;Ms. Schwarzer, 70 to 80 percent of the rapists in Cologne are Turkish.&quot; I was very upset and said: &quot;Then good God, why don't you bring the issue up?&quot; Because only after you call a problem by name can you change it. And then he said, no way, that's not politically opportune. So you see, the police have long been extremely frustrated by these hush-ups. I think that's changing now, and that's a good thing.&#xA;Wizorek: But that's just another version of this terrible: &quot;One should also be able to say !&quot;&#xA;Schwarzer: No, it's the opposite. People aren't stupid. They saw what was happening at the Cologne central station. A lawless space was created in the middle of a city of over a million. That has to be addressed and it has to be done so in a sober-minded way.&#xA;SPIEGEL: But does Ms. Wizorek not have a point when she asks why the conservative Christian Democrats suddenly discover a passion for women's issues right when there are problems with refugees?&#xA;Schwarzer: That's not a partisan question. The same is true of the center-left Social Democrats. It applies to all. The current outrage is very hypocritical. But motives haven't been interesting to me for a long time now. I'm more interested in what someone does. If the government now finally tightens rape laws, all the better.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Is it not a huge setback for the women's movement when hundreds of thousands of young men from male-dominated societies come to Germany in a single year?&#xA;Schwarzer: I can't just go up to people standing in the snow at the German-Austrian border and ask them: &quot;Are you an Islamist?&quot; When people flee to us from war zones, we first have to help. But we also have to be quick to look very closely at who it is that is coming.&#xA;Wizorek: Patriarchy also exists here in Germany. The right to asylum cannot be restricted just because people come to Germany from countries that represent more sexist attitudes.&#xA;SPIEGEL: How should politicians respond to the events in Cologne? Do we need rules that allow for the faster deportation of migrants, as the conservatives are now demanding?&#xA;Wizorek: This is not the debate that we need to be having. Perpetrators clearly need to be punished, but the problem of sexualized violence has already existed here for some time and can't simply be &quot;deported.&quot; Doing so doesn't solve the fundamental problem. Instead, Germany needs to tighten its laws governing sexual offences. We need to establish more crisis centers for the victims of violence. There are too few of them and people who work there are often poorly paid or are volunteers.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Could the events in Cologne have been prevented with tighter rape laws? The primary issue in the debate over those laws is the firmness with which a woman must say that she does not want to have sex. When it comes to Cologne, you really can't accuse the women of not having shown that clearly enough.&#xA;Schwarzer: Even stricter rape laws wouldn't have done anything to stop the crimes in Cologne. Groping, a trivializing word, isn't even a prosecutable offense yet.&#xA;Wizorek: This is why I am calling for sexual harassment to be made a criminal offence. But there is also the fundamental problem that it is always assumed that women want all of that. Our world is strongly shaped by hypersexualized images of female bodies that are presented as being available. At the same time, we still haven't found language with which we can speak about intimacy. That also contributes to a climate in which assault gets normalized.&#xA;SPIEGEL: Ms. Schwarzer, what consequences will Cologne have?&#xA;Schwarzer: We need to finally be proactive in enlightening people from Islamic cultural groups. And this applies to immigrants already here as well as to current refugees. The German constitution stands above the Sharia. Schools need to offer classes on gender equality. You also have to offer an alternative to young men with a penchant for violence.&#xA;Wizorek: Only the young men? Education is important for all genders.&#xA;Schwarzer: Of course, because you have to tell girls what rights they have and you must stand by them as they assert themselves. We have to go into the relevant neighborhoods and do something to counter the campaigning Islamists. We failed to do that during the last 25 years. We also can't be naïve when it comes to the refugees. Men who commit violence should of course be deported to their countries of origin. We already have enough problems here and we don't need to import anymore.&#xA;Wizorek: Sexualized violence existed before the refugees -- it has not been imported.&#xA;Schwarzer: I know that because I have been fighting against it since 1995, just like all the women SPIEGEL likes to call the &quot;old feminists.&quot; For us feminist pioneers, fighting sexual violence, which until then was totally silenced -- be it abuse, rape within marriage or sex killings -- has always been given top priority.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

It's also the place that Donald Trump's grandfather called home before emigrating to America. Locals are ambivalent about the man's politics and his bid for the presidency.&#xA;America might be a different place today were it not for the village of Kallstadt in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It's a sleepy place located west of Mannheim amidst vineyard-covered hills. A church rises in the center, surrounded by a few pubs and red gabled roofs. The local bakery closes early in the afternoon.&#xA;About 1,200 people call Kallstadt home. Residents like to make merry and they are proud of their local culinary specialty, Saumagen, stuffed pork belly. It's former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's favorite dish and it's said that he often came here to buy it. But are locals proud of their most famous family?&#xA;After all, the village is the ancestral home of the Trumps.&#xA;&quot;My father is Donald Trump's third cousin,&quot; says Bernd Weisenborn, with a broad grin planted on his face. The 54-year-old is standing in the courtyard of his restaurant.&#xA;An icy January wind blows through the village's narrow streets, but Weisenborn is in short sleeves. He has blond hair, strong hands and his glasses dangle from his neck.&#xA;The Trumps of Kallstadt&#xA;Donald Trump, the grandson of a German emigrant, has gone about as far as a man go go in the United States. Among other residences, he lives in an apartment located near New York's Central Park.&#xA;But Trump's roots lie elsewhere: In the village of Kallstadt, Germany. Donald Trump's grandfather lived here before emigrating to the United States in 1885.&#xA;Donald Trump, the most famous of the family's offspring, currently lives on Fifth Avenue when he spends time in New York.&#xA;This is the street the Trump Family called home in Kallstadt, Germany, a village located in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate.&#xA;This is the house in Kallstadt that locals say served as the Trump Family home.&#xA;It's modest compared to the Trump Tower, which Donald Trump calls home when in New York.&#xA;Although some residents don't like to talk about Trump's views, there are plenty of politics going on in Kallstadt. Here, a campaign poster for a candidate with the conservative Christian Democratic Union party.&#xA;Trump's popularity is such that he no longer has to put up signs -- instead he can enjoy his celebrity and simply put his autograph on them.&#xA;He doesn't know that much about his ancestors, Weisenborn, a vintner, grumbles. He says his father used to talk every now and then about the old Trumps, but otherwise it wasn't something that came up very often.&#xA;Weisenborn says he doesn't care how close his bloodlines are with Trump, the billionaire real estate mogul currently vying for the White House with his hardline rhetoric.&#xA;Obviously it's something special if a famous person shares roots from the same place you come from, he says. But would he like to meet Trump? &quot;I would if the opportunity arose,&quot; Weisenborn says. And what about having Trump as a visitor here in Kallstadt? &quot;I wouldn't mind at all,&quot; he adds. But when asked about Trump's current campaign, Weisenborn is decidedly less enthusiastic.&#xA;Trump, who is currently stirring up sentiment against foreigners in the US, is himself the product of immigration -- a history that leads back to 1885. That's the year people here claim Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich, packed his bags and departed rather suddenly for America. Friedrich was 16 at the time. Upon arrival, he first worked in New York as a barber and later managed a hotel on the West Coast before opening a bar for gold prospectors in the Yukon. Friedrich bought property in Manhattan with the money he earned. The sites where Trump's flashy towers are located today were dirt cheap back then.&#xA;But Friedrich Trump then returned to Germany, where he married Elisabeth, who lived next door.&#xA;The Trump Family&#xA;This image is believed to be of Elisabeth and Friedrich Trump, who emigrated to the United States and would become Donald Trump's grandparents. They are pictured here in 1902.&#xA;Elisabeth and Friedrich Trump are believed to be seen in this photo with their three children around 1915. The oldest son (left) is Fred Trump, Donald's father.&#xA;Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is pictured here in December 2015.&#xA;Here, Trump poses with his family at Trump Tower in New York during a campaign event.&#xA;Elisabeth wanted to remain in Kallstadt, but Friedrich wasn't allowed to. The Kingdom of Bavaria, which controlled Palatinate at the time, declared that Friedrich had forfeited his citizenship by emigrating.&#xA;So the young couple sailed to the United States where, after a few years, Trump died. In order to provide for her children, Elisabeth founded the E. Trump &amp; Son company, the foundations of what would later become a real estate empire.&#xA;&quot;That's the house,&quot; says Romy Feuerbach, pointing to a modest building where Trump's ancestors lived. A deep-blue sign at the entry gate reads, &quot;God sees everything, but my neighbor sees even more.&quot;&#xA;Feuerbach is a senior official in town. Her purple-rimmed glasses darken in the sun. When she talks about Kallstadt, the town's florists, the different organizations, she smiles. &quot;This is still the kind of village where everyone looks out for each other,&quot; Feuerbach says. When the subject of Donald Trump is raised, she grows silent, saying she doesn't want to talk politics. &quot;It's not that we don't care&quot; about the town's celebrity connection, &quot;we just don't make much of a fuss about it.&quot;&#xA;In Kallstadt today, the only place you can still find the Trump name is on gravestones. There is no information board about the family or any street named after them. Not too long ago, though, the village began rediscovering its past.&#xA;What Kallstadt Residents Say About Trump&#xA;Local butcher shop saleswoman Edelgard Kellermann thinks Donald Trump is &quot;full of hot air.&quot;&#xA;Pointing to Donald Trump's many outrageous statements on the campaign trail, Bernd Weisenborn, a local vintner and distant German relative of the American real estate mogul, says you &quot;don't always have to be proud&quot; of the politician's campaign.&#xA;Romy Feuerbach, Kallstadt's deputy mayor, says that while locals certainly know of the connection to the American celebrity, they don't make much fuss about it.&#xA;Some locals are rather ambivalent about Donald Trump. Sandra Krieger, seen here walking her dog, says he just &quot;doesn't fit with who we are.&quot;&#xA;But Trump does have some fans here as well. Adolf Sauer is seen here holding up a copy of the politician's recent book, &quot;Crippled America.&quot; He says he hopes the billionaire will become America's next president.&#xA;Kallstadt is famous for a few things. In addition to the Trumps, the Heinz family, known around the world for their ketchup, also comes from the village. In Germany, however, it is better known for&#xA;Saumagen&#xA;, or stuffed pork belly, the local specialty.&#xA;Young filmmaker Simone Wendel, who also happens to be a distant relative of the Trumps, made a documentary film about her hometown in 2014 called the &quot;Kings of Kallstadt&quot; that explored its most famous native sons. In addition to the Trumps, the billionaire Heinz ketchup family also hails from the village.&#xA;During the making of her film, Wendel traveled to New York to interview Trump. The billionaire apparently knew very little about his family's past and said he had never visited the village. After the war, he said his family claimed for a long time to have come from Sweden. But Trump did say in Wendel's film, &quot;I love Kallstadt.&quot;&#xA;Many residents of Kallstadt have familial links to the Trumps. And some fear those links could become a burden if the Republican politician's vulgar remarks draw unwanted attention, particularly from rival villages. It is typical for the region that villages make fun of each other, and the surrounding settlements accuse people from Kallstadt of being braggarts. Residents are not happy that Trump is not exactly disproving that image.&#xA;&quot;He's full of hot air,&quot; says one sales woman at a local butcher shop. &quot;It doesn't fit with who we are,&quot; says another woman walking her dog. Of Trump's election campaign, vintner Weisenborn says it's &quot;not something you always have to be proud of.&quot;&#xA;There is one man in town, though, who sees things a bit differently. Adolf Sauer, a 75-year-old with a mustache and white hair, lives just outside the village with his wife. Pewter plates are hung on the walls and a heavy oak cabinet stands in the corner. Sauer explains that he, too, has emigrants in his family. Even though they aren't related to the presidential candidate, Sauer says he likes the Trump story. He then holds a book in his hand that an American friend gave to him: &quot;Crippled America,&quot; written by Trump.&#xA;Sauer isn't planning on reading it because he doesn't speak any English. But he still likes the idea that someone with a bit of Kallstadt in his blood is living the glamorous life in America, despite all Trump's escapades. After all, when people in Kallstadt do things, they tend to do them with great commitment, Sauer says. It's hardly surprising, he says, that some will find fame as a result. Finally, he adds, &quot;I hope that Donald Trump becomes America's boss.&quot;&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

Chancellor Running Out of Time on Refugee Issue&#xA;REUTERS&#xA;The mood in Germany is rapidly shifting, and Chancellor Angela Merkel is under fire.&#xA;Angela Merkel has repeatedly said that it will take time to solve the refugee crisis. But impatience is growing, particularly following the sexual assaults in Cologne. Voices of discontent are getting louder and the chancellor's hold on power may be weakening. By SPIEGEL Staff&#xA;The most unusual tribunal in the republic meets around 25 times per year, usually on Tuesdays in the gray-panelled conference room on the third floor of the Reichstag where conservative parliamentarians often meet. At the front sits the defendant, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Her accusers sit at the long rows of tables before her, the three or four dozen back benchers who are increasingly adopting the tone of a public prosecutor when addressing Merkel's refugee policies.&#xA;Last week saw the most recent such session. &quot;We must finally begin to effectively register the refugees,&quot; said Armin Schuster, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats who specializes in domestic affairs. &quot;We can't keep quiet about uncomfortable truths,&quot; complained fellow-CDU member Klaus-Peter Willsch. Mark Hauptmann, another conservative from the state of Thuringia, said: &quot;We have to reduce the number of illegal migrants coming to Germany from the Balkans.&quot;&#xA;The accused, who in the past had made a habit of delivering extended remarks in her own defense, said nothing this time in response. She silently listened to the accusations while tapping listlessly into her mobile phone or staring at the ceiling in annoyance.&#xA;It wasn't all that long ago that things were radically different. Only a month ago, the CDU met in Karlsruhe for its annual party conference and Merkel's refugee policies received a standing ovation. Merkel took the stage intent on placating her critics and she promised a &quot;noticeable decrease&quot; in the number of refugees coming to Germany. The pledge was well received by the delegates present -- such that newspapers wrote afterwards of Merkel's &quot;triumph.&quot;&#xA;But then came New Year's Eve in Cologne, and since then everything has changed -- both in Merkel's party and across the country. The occasionally shrill debates in talk shows, on the Internet and on the streets have become even shriller. Among politicians in Berlin, calls for something to be done have grown both in number and volume. And within the population, where attitudes toward Merkel's policies have for months wavered between sympathy and skepticism, concerns are growing: Will the effort to integrate more than a million refugees overwhelm German society? Can the government still guarantee the safety of its citizens? Is the state failing?&#xA;And the pressure is rising quickly in Berlin as well. On Tuesday, the Chancellery received a letter signed by 44 conservative parliamentarians demanding that Merkel reverse course on the refugee issue. &quot;Just as in similar cases in the past,&quot; one of the initiators told the German press agency DPA, &quot;we expect an answer within a week.&quot;&#xA;Merkel's decision to offer shelter to the greatest possible number of refugees from the horrors of the Syrian civil war remains the correct one. And it is understandable that Merkel is hesitant to close Germany's borders because of the danger that such a move might spell an end to border-free travel in Europe.&#xA;'High-Minded Folly'&#xA;But Merkel has failed to promptly impose order on the streams of refugees flowing into the country. Now, even her supporters are concerned that her plan for a European solution to the problem could fail. Former allies, such as the government of Sweden, have reintroduced tight border controls. Conservative German Constitutional Court justices such as Udo Di Fabio and Hans-Jürgen Papier have accused Merkel of making grave mistakes. And even a center-left paper like the New York Times, which for much of 2015 couldn't praise Merkel's refugee policies enough, recently published a column describing her course as a &quot; high-minded folly .&quot;&#xA;Among German conservatives, as well, the criticism has grown sharper. If at all possible, Merkel would like to stick with her policies. But within her CDU, many believe that there isn't enough time left for her plan to find success. The CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), has recently turned the screws even tighter. &quot;In the next 14 days, we will submit a written demand to the federal government to reestablish legally regulated conditions at the borders,&quot; said CSU head Horst Seehofer recently. &quot;If it does not do so, the Bavarian government will have no choice but to submit a complaint to the Federal Constitutional Court.&quot;&#xA;The clock has begun to tick. Either Merkel and Seehofer will be able to find a compromise prior to an important trio of state elections in March. Or the chancellor faces a lasting power struggle with her own political allies -- a tussle that could ultimately cost her the Chancellery.&#xA;The fact that the refugee crisis has now intensified is not entirely due to the scandalous events on New Year's Eve in Cologne. The primary reason is that Merkel has made little progress with her plan to stop the inflow of refugees at the EU's external borders. Negotiations with Turkey have faltered and Germany's neighbors in the Continent's south and east are refusing to help. &quot;Europe,&quot; a member of Merkel's cabinet recently complained, &quot;is leaving us hanging.&quot;&#xA;Just last fall, Merkel hammered out a promising plan together with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The idea was for refugees arriving in Europe by boat or ferry to be registered in special camps (known as hotspots ) in Greece and Italy before being distributed in fixed quotas among the other EU member states. At the same time, Brussels hoped to seal off Europe's Mediterranean beaches with the help of the EU border control agency Frontex, if necessary over the opposition of the countries in question.&#xA;A Redistribution Farce&#xA;Thus far, though, such plans are more theory than practice. The so-called initial reception facilities lack the means to even take the fingerprints of all those arriving. In order to fix the problem, the European Commission recently authorized emergency funds to acquire 90 fingerprint machines.&#xA;At the same time, the plan to redistribute 160,000 refugees across the EU has become a farce. The plan was agreed to back in September, but by Jan. 7, a mere 272 people had been resettled. Even worse, the resistance isn't just coming from the most vocal critics of Merkel's refugee policy in Poland and Hungary. Her supposed allies in the heart of the EU are also protesting. &quot;Almost none of the countries in the EU are implementing the decisions made in the European Council, neither in the east or the west,&quot; complained Council President Donald Tusk last Tuesday at a meeting with Social Democrats in the European Parliament.&#xA;As such, Merkel can, for the time being, forget about her idea of bringing fixed contingents of refugees to Europe directly from Turkey. Even EU countries that count among her allies first want to see a reduction in the number of refugees coming to Europe.&#xA;The horrors experienced by the women in Cologne on New Year's Eve have also done their part to reduce the willingness to accept refugees, particularly in Eastern Europe. &quot;We don't want something like what happened in Germany taking place in Slovakia,&quot; the country's prime minister, Robert Fico, said in Bratislava earlier this month.&#xA;In addition, Turkey is also letting Merkel squirm. There have been some positive signals, Frans Timmermans, deputy president of the European Commission, said after a visit to Turkey early last week. But EU officials have noted in recent months that it's not just Syrians and Afghans who are traveling through Turkey on their way to Europe, but also people from North Africa -- allegedly because the partly state-owned Turkish Airlines is profiting handsomely on flights from the region. The vast majority of those coming from North Africa are ineligible for asylum, but have proven difficult to deport due to a lack of cooperation from their home countries.&#xA;Experts in Brussels are thus running out of hope that the number of refugees flowing into Europe can be quickly reduced. At the moment, some 3,000 people are arriving in Greece every day, and that's in January with storms raging in the Aegean Sea. Soon, though, temperatures will start to rise and the crossing will become easier once again.&#xA;German conservatives are no longer willing to simply hope the refugee influx will slow on its own. Just how bad the mood has become became apparent last Monday in Berlin, when Bundestag members from Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg held a joint meeting. One parliamentarian after the other demanded stricter border controls and an upper limit to the number of refugees Germany can accept. Bavarian conservatives with the CSU have been demanding such measures for some time. But the CDU parliamentarians from Baden-Württemberg &quot;are now even more radical than we are,&quot; said a CSU parliamentarian approvingly.&#xA;The letter delivered to the Chancellery this Tuesday likewise demands the introduction of an upper limit. &quot;Germany cannot handle more than 200,000 immigrants per year, whether they are civil war refugees or asylum-seekers,&quot; reads the letter, which SPIEGEL ONLINE has seen. The CSU has long been demanding that the upper limit for immigration be set at 200,000 annually. &quot;We are extremely concerned,&quot; the letter continues, &quot;that without the quick introduction of a limit, far more refugees could come to Germany in 2016 than arrived in 2015.&quot; According to official statistics, just short of 1.1 million refugees, migrants and asylum seekers crossed into Germany in 2015, though it is unclear how many of those may have been registered twice or continued on to other European countries.&#xA;Finding a Different Path&#xA;Even a member of Merkel's cabinet has recently begun publicly opposing Chancellor Merkel's course. Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt, a member of the CSU, warned that the crimes committed in Cologne have made Germans deeply concerned about their security. &quot;The more people feel personally affected, the more they begin to question the core competence of the conservative parties,&quot; Dobrindt warned.&#xA;Many conservatives share his view. At the meeting of parliamentary conservatives last Tuesday, representatives who had thus far supported Merkel's refugee policies voiced concern. Even leading CSU parliamentarian Gerda Hasselfeldt, who has often sought to mediate between Merkel and Seehofer, demanded vehemently -- for her -- that it has to be possible to turn refugees away at the border if they are not in possession of valid identification. Loyal conservatives like Hesse Governor Volker Bouffier have likewise gone public with their doubts about Merkel's plan: &quot;I am still in favor of a European solution,&quot; he said. &quot;But if progress is blocked in Europe, then one has to find a different path.&quot;&#xA;The number of extremist hate mails and emails directed at the parliamentarians is not the only thing that has spiked. The number of queries from unsettled Germans who have nothing to do with xenophobic movements like Pegida or other right-wing groups has likewise increased significantly. That has led many parliamentarians who had thus far supported Merkel to change their approach. &quot;Those in favor of a different strategy are now distinctly in the majority,&quot; says one representative.&#xA;Of particular concern for Merkel is that a growing number of parliamentarians are less worried that their criticism might damage the chancellor. &quot;Thus far, there was a consensus that we had to solve the refugee crisis with Merkel at the helm,&quot; says a senior CDU politician. &quot;Now, some are saying, we have to solve the problem, without Merkel if necessary. That is still a minority, but it is a growing minority.&quot;&#xA;Just as it has for the past several months, however, the greatest pressure is coming from the CSU. With his announcement that he might file a complaint against Merkel in the Federal Constitutional Court, Seehofer isn't just making a concession to party hardliners like Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Söder, who is demanding that Merkel's refugee policies be put up for a vote in federal parliament. Seehofer is also thinking about his state's financial interests. Bavaria, after all, is on the frontlines of the refugee crisis, with the vast majority of migrants entering Germany through Bavaria's border with Austria. Were the court to rule in Bavaria's favor, Seehofer has indicated, he would make new financial demands from Berlin. &quot;Against that background, one must now more than ever think about whether the federal government must participate to a greater degree in the costs,&quot; says Seehofer.&#xA;Danger Ahead&#xA;Money has always been a good argument in politics, but votes are even more important. And here too there is bad news for Merkel. Many conservatives have long been hoping that losses in the upcoming state elections could be limited. Internally, the CDU wasn't particularly concerned about the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining a bit of support so long as the CDU was able to emerge as the strongest party and secure the governor position.&#xA;But recent surveys now show that the CDU result could be worse than feared. Those surveys show that the AfD may not just exceed the five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation in March, but could also emerge with a two-digit result in Baden-Württemberg. Furthermore, sinking CDU poll numbers in both Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate make it possible that Merkel's party could emerge from both state elections without the governorship, depending on the make-up of the ultimate governing coalition. That would be a disaster for Merkel. Defeats in important state elections have always been dangerous for sitting chancellors, most recently hastening the end of Gerhard Schröder's term in office.&#xA;Merkel is fully aware that she is running out of time. If she isn't soon able to demonstrate that she is making headway, she could be in trouble. Even her own confidants say as much. &quot;Then we would be facing a power struggle,&quot; says one.&#xA;Chancellor Merkel, for her part, continues to insist that proposals made by her opponents won't work. Closing the border to Austria? She believes that doing so risks setting off a domino-effect that would ultimately destroy the Schengen border-free travel regime and destabilize the Balkans.&#xA;Merkel is particularly concerned about the gradual erosion of her authority. Throughout her time in office, she has earned a reputation as someone who has mastered all of the crises facing Germany and Europe. Now, however, every promise Merkel makes is bursting like a soap bubble. German voters are watching Merkel fail at one of the most fundamental tasks facing a state: That of controlling who enters the country.&#xA;The Chancellery, of course, has long since begun working on a potential Plan B. But it won't be the complete sealing of Germany's borders: The loss of face for Merkel would be too great. Instead, aids are looking at other possibilities, including that of turning away certain groups -- those from Afghanistan, for example -- at the border. That would at least demonstrate a desire to reassert control over the German border without necessarily putting an end to the idea of open borders in Europe.&#xA;Help from the Balkans&#xA;Among conservative leaders, another idea, one favored by the Austrians, is gaining support. The plan calls for German and Austrian police to assist their colleagues in Slovenia, and possibly Croatia as well, with securing the EU's external borders. Asylum-seekers trying to enter with forged documents or with no papers at all would be turned back. The hope is that such a plan would significantly reduce the number of refugees coming to Europe by way of the so-called Balkan Route.&#xA;Last Wednesday, Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner spoke about the proposal with Emily Haber, state secretary in the German Interior Ministry. It is well-known that German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière is not opposed to preventing certain groups of refugees from entering Germany in the first place. Out of loyalty to Merkel, however, he has thus far not issued the relevant orders to Germany's federal police force.&#xA;Shifting the onus for control onto the Slovenian and Croatian border would raise a number of practical and legal questions. Politically, though, it would be an elegant solution, allowing Merkel to make a partial retreat without loss of face and making it possible to reach a compromise with the CSU.&#xA;Sources in the Interior Ministry say that they will soon begin looking intensively at the Austrian proposal: &quot;Quickly and with the necessary care.&quot;&#xA;By Melanie Amann, Peter Müller, Ralf Neukirch, René Pfister, Michael Sauga and Christoph Schult&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

" content="EU Council President Tusk Says He Is Unloved By Warsaw&#xA;European Council Head Tusk: 'I Am Public Enemy No. 1' in Poland&#xA;By Peter Müller in Brussels&#xA;DPA&#xA;European Council President Donald Tusk: &quot;I'm Public Enemy Number One&quot; in Poland.&#xA;Polish European Council President Donald Tusk has said little about the constitutional crisis in his home country. But during a closed-door meeting at the European Parliament on Tuesday, he did little to hide his views.&#xA;There won't be any lack of problems in 2016 to test European Council President Donald Tusk's talent as a crisis manager. The refugee crisis is far from having been solved and continues to strain European solidarity almost daily. On top of that comes the planned referendum in Britain to determine whether the country will remain a member of the European Union.&#xA;But no crisis has caused as many headaches for Tusk, who heads the powerful EU institution representing the leaders of the 28 member states, as the situation back in his home country of Poland. The newly elected government in Warsaw has been busy stripping away constitutional structures , the power of the constitutional court threatens to be hollowed out and the government now has the final say in senior posts at the country's public radio and television broadcasters.&#xA;Every sentence uttered on the issue by Tusk is a delicate one. Behind closed doors, though, he makes no secret about where he stands. Which brings us to Tuesday evening, when Tusk was a guest at a meeting of the Green Party parliamentary group in European Parliament and one of the Socialist parliamentary group. The appointments had been made long ago, but they came just as Poland has emerged as one of the most controversial current topics in the EU. And on Tuesday, it was all people wanted to talk about.&#xA;Following harsh criticism by leading EU politicians against the new Polish government, Tusk called for restraint. &quot;Of course, personally, I am very critical of many actions taken by the new authorities in my country,&quot; he told his audience at one of the meetings, according to participants. &quot;Exaggerated opinions and sometimes also brutal epithets regardless of the goodwill of the authors, my friends here in Brussels, can be counter-effective.&quot;&#xA;Tusk's reference was to statements made by European Parliament President Martin Schulz, of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), and German EU Commissioner Günther Oettinger, of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Last weekend, Schulz likened the Polish government's actions to Putin's style of rule in Russia. Oettinger, for his part, demanded that Poland be placed under &quot;supervision.&quot;&#xA;A 'Legal and Moral Responsibility' to Probe Poland&#xA;On Wednesday, the European Commission, the EU's executive, opened the so-called &quot;rule of law mechanism&quot; for the first time in its history against Poland in order to review its adherence to the rule of law and to the values of the European Union. On Monday, Tusk is expected to discuss the issue with Polish President Andrzej Duda, who will be visiting the European capital. One day later, the European Parliament is to discuss developments at a session in Strasbourg with new Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo.&#xA;Tusk, who served as Polish prime minister from 2007 until 2014, has said he could also see the European Council taking up the issue of Poland, the body that would be responsible for any possible sanctions. &quot;I have no doubts that, also for the European Council, the Polish problem is interesting enough to discuss,&quot; he said at one of the Tuesday night meetings. He added that the European institutions and he himself had the &quot;moral but also legal obligation&quot; to engage in an &quot;open dialogue&quot; with a member state where the rule of law and norms of democracy are at risk of being violated.&#xA;The Polish European Council president had been German Chancellor Angela Merkel's favored candidate, but his first year in office was anything but easy. Given that Poland isn't a member of the common currency zone, he had a handicap in the debate over whether Greece should be allowed to remain in the euro zone. And in terms of the refugee crisis, at least in the beginning, he gave what many felt to be too much consideration for the Polish government's position and elections there in October, and was slow in acting.&#xA;Still, Tusk has been a productive participant in the refugee debate. He proved to be correct, for example, in his skepticism of an obligatory redistribution mechanism for refugees in the EU that Merkel and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had pushed for. He repeatedly warned it was more important to take steps to secure the EU's external borders, a policy Merkel has since adopted as a priority.&#xA;During his meeting with the Greens, Tusk made no secret of the fact that he doesn't expect to be treated particularly well by the new government in Warsaw. To put it mildly, his relationship with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the nationalist-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, the man pulling the strings in the new government, is tense. &quot;To most politicians representing the new power in Poland, I am Public Enemy Number One,&quot; Tusk told the Greens, &quot;for many reasons -- but also because I am here in Brussels as the president of the European Council.&quot;&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

Is President Erdogan capable of stopping the Islamic State -- and does he even want to? By SPIEGEL Staff&#xA;Minutes after the explosion, when Robert H. came to, he only had one thought: Get out of here! His ears were ringing and his head was throbbing. But he briefly stopped to think. Where was his wife? He looked around and saw body parts lying around: disembodied legs, a head. People were screaming for help. Anke H. was lying on the ground, bleeding. She stammered: I can't breathe. Robert H. bound up the wound on her leg with a piece of cloth.&#xA;On Wednesday morning, the day after the bombing in a district of Istanbul frequented by tourists, the two were lying in their hospital room in the Capa Clinic. Robert H., an early retiree from Bavaria, is 61 years old and his wife Anke is 53. He has abrasions on his face, a bandage on his leg and a head full of images that he can't get rid of. &quot;The place was a battlefield,&quot; he says.&#xA;Ten Germans died in the attack in Istanbul and eight others were injured, some of them seriously. Among the dead are a 75-year-old from Dresden and his son, a 73-year-old real-estate consultant from Bad Kreuznach and an entrepreneur, 67, from the state of Hesse. Also among the dead is a married couple, 71 and 73, from Falkensee in the state of Brandenburg. &quot;Traveling was their passion,&quot; says their daughter-in-law, adding that they enjoyed visiting Muslim countries, even after the attacks in Tunisia and Egypt. A 70-year-old elementary school teacher from Leipzig also lost her life. After the Paris attacks, she posted a picture of herself on Facebook in the colors of the French flag. She also loved to travel and posted images of her trip to America. In most of the pictures, she could be seen smiling into the camera.&#xA;A Triple Blow to Turkey&#xA;Almost all the people who lost their lives were retirees who came from all corners of Germany: 33 people traveling with the tour operator Lebenslust. They were people who wanted to experience the Orient on a 10-day trip including stops in Istanbul, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. And then came the bomb, which exploded at 10:20 a.m. between the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, in the heart of the old-city quarter of Sultanahmet. It is where Europe and Asia meet, where Christianity butts up against Islam, where Turkey's past meets tourist modernity. It is where millions of visitors to the city go to take selfies in front of Istanbul's most famous sites. It is hard to find a more symbolic place.&#xA;The attack is a triple blow to Turkey. It disgraces an almost omnipotent state apparatus, which once again has proven itself unable to prevent a bloodbath in the center of a large Turkish city. It damages the country's tourism industry, which is one of Turkey's most important economic sectors. And it hits Istanbul, this mega-metropolis with 14 million inhabitants and 10 million visitors every year. Ankara may be the political capital of Turkey, but Istanbul is the cultural, economic and societal heart of the country. And it is proof that Islam and modernity can coexist.&#xA;&quot;This day will change our country,&quot; says Ayse Danisoglu, a parliamentarian with the Republican People's Party (CHP). The attack, he says, is &quot;ground zero&quot; for Turkey's anti-terror policies.&#xA;It is far from the first time the country has been the target of a terrorist assault. Just last year, there were two of them: On July 20, 2015, a bomb attack killed 34 people in Suruc; and on Oct. 10, 2015, two suicide bombers killed 102 people in Ankara. There were no claims of responsibility for either attack, but the Islamic State (IS) is suspected in both. Then came the bloody day of Jan. 12. There were fewer victims this time, but the shock will likely linger. For the message of the terrorists is clear: We can attack anywhere at any time.&#xA;It is still unclear if IS was behind the Istanbul attack, but the way it was carried out as well as the attacker's alleged origins point to the group's involvement. Nabil Fadli is thought to be the name of the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. He was born in 1988 in Saudi Arabia and was registered as a refugee on Jan. 5 in Istanbul, according to Turkish officials. Fadli was allegedly identified by his fingerprints, but the claim has been impossible to confirm because Turkish officials have refused to supply additional information on their investigation. &quot;Thus far, there is a lack of solid evidence&quot; reads an internal analysis of the attacks by authorities.&#xA;The police protocol notes that the Turkish tour guide heard &quot;a clicking sound&quot; shortly before the blast. She spotted a man wearing Western clothes and a goatee in the middle of the group who didn't belong. The police report says she thought he was a Turkish man. She screamed in German: &quot;Run away!&quot; -- and then the bomb went off.&#xA;Were Germans Deliberate Targets?&#xA;Perhaps greater clarity isn't necessary to send out the disturbing message: that no country, no place where Europeans go on vacation, is safe. That it doesn't matter who is hit, because everyone is an enemy -- and thus, a target -- for the terrorists. Even retirees from Germany.&#xA;It is thus far unclear whether the attack was specifically intended to target Germans as a response to the country's military involvement in the airstrikes being carried out against Islamic State in Syria. It was only a few days ago that German Tornado reconnaissance planes began taking off for Syria from the Turkish military base in Incirlik.&#xA;German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière quickly sought to dismiss such concerns. &quot;I don't see any reason to avoid traveling to Turkey,&quot; he said. But German security officials have a different view. &quot;Those who say there are no indications that Germans were the target of the attack should also be honest enough to say that there are no indications that they weren't,&quot; says one high-ranking government official.&#xA;De Maizière's words are thus better interpreted as an attempt to reassure the Germans and as a courtesy to the Turks. Berlin, after all, is more dependent than ever on goodwill from Ankara, particularly when it comes to solving the refugee crisis. The European Union recently promised Ankara 3 billion and the easing of visa requirements if Turkey makes an effort to prevent refugees from embarking on the journey to Europe. In addition, the Chancellery has for weeks refrained from criticism when it comes to authoritarian tendencies exhibited by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Ankara's aggressive policies toward the Kurds and the country's approach to fighting terrorism.&#xA;Berlin is now hoping that the shock from the attack will help heal the growing split in Turkish society. And that Erdogan will finally focus his attentions on IS now that it's not just Kurds who are dying, but also German tourists. Perhaps, though, that is a bit too much to hope for. This week, at least, there was little evidence that introspection was on the agenda.&#xA;Turkey Long Underestimated Extremist Threat&#xA;The government has presented the attack in Istanbul as a conspiracy, with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu saying that &quot;secret powers&quot; had used IS as a &quot;subcontractor.&quot; The tabloid Star, which is closely linked to the state, accused Russia of having orchestrated the attack. Just as it did following the attack in Ankara, the Turkish government is attempting to use conspiracy theories to distract from its own failures.&#xA;Turkey, after all, long underestimated the danger presented by Islamist extremists and thus helped their ascent. When the insurgency in Syria began, Erdogan hoped to finally be able to topple Bashar Assad with the help of Syrian fundamentalists. He ignored -- or perhaps simply accepted -- who exactly he was supporting in the effort. And he ignored the fact that IS was becoming ever stronger.&#xA;Whereas Jordan's security services prevented foreigners from traveling onward to Syria, making it unattractive for jihadists, Turkey basically welcomed them. Jihadists from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, the Caucasus and Western Europe were neither intercepted nor prevented from traveling onward to the warzone. And they weren't difficult to spot: At the airport of Hatay, a city in southern Turkey, bearded men would check in for their flights home wearing battle fatigues and with mud on their shoes.&#xA;For years, IS was able to maintain apartments, warehouses and even military training camps in Turkey. The group was also able to organize supplies of weapons, munitions, food and medicines via Turkey. Islamic State sent its fighters to Turkish hospitals near the Syrian border for treatment. Dubious companies issued certificates of employment so that foreign jihadists were able to get year-long residency permits with no trouble at all.&#xA;Islamic State was also able to recruit new followers with virtually no fear of interference -- and officials simply ignored information provided by Turkish parents whose children had joined the extremists. As recently as 2014, IS was able to openly recruit new followers in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities. Young men and women from around the world only had to visit the teahouses neighboring certain mosques to join the group, while shops openly sold IS souvenirs, such as banners, stickers and flags.&#xA;Concern Came Too Late&#xA;This laissez-faire approach was slowly replaced by concern in 2014, but by then it was too late. So many IS supporters and fighters were active in Turkey that they had become a danger to the country's security. Yet instead of doing something about it, the decision was apparently made to avoid putting pressure on them in the hopes that Turkey wouldn't become a target as well.&#xA;An unofficial member of the Turkish secret service MIT said in mid-2014 that he had never seen officials so nervous. &quot;They are really afraid of IS because they know that their cells are everywhere in the country and could perpetrate attacks,&quot; he said. Initially, though, the jihadists refrained from carrying out attacks so as not to endanger their bridgeheads elsewhere in the world.&#xA;That changed last summer with the attack on Suruc, which is thought to have been carried out by IS, likely to fan the flames of Turkey's conflict with the Kurds. The Kurds, after all, are Islamic State's largest and most powerful enemy in both Syria and Iraq.&#xA;The shock over the 34 people killed in the attack -- in addition to added pressure from the US and Europe and the negative headlines about their lax approach to IS -- moved Turkey to finally intensify its pursuit of the jihadists. Checks at borders and airports were increased and suspects were arrested -- more than 400 of them in 2015, according to the think tank Crisis Group.&#xA;After initial hesitation, Ankara joined the international coalition against the terror militia and provided the Americans with access to military bases. At least since then, Islamic State has seen Turkey as an enemy. In an IS propaganda video, Erdogan was cursed as the &quot;devil&quot; and calls were made for the &quot;conquer of Istanbul.&quot;&#xA;Recently, IS issued warnings in Turkish-language videos of an impending attack. The Turkish daily Hürriyet also reported on two tips that Turkey's MIT intelligence service allegedly passed along on Dec. 17 and Jan. 4. In its tips, the intelligence service reportedly warned that suicide attackers in Ankara and Istanbul were awaiting deployment. On New Year's Eve, two Turks were arrested who had allegedly admitted a short time before they intended to carry out an attack in the capital city.&#xA;A Shift in IS' Strategy&#xA;Whereas previous attacks had targeted Kurds, Washington-based terrorism expert Aaron Stein argues the latest attack indicates a shift in IS strategy, showing it now seeks to inflict damage on the Turkish economy by attacking tourists.&#xA;Terrorism researcher Peter Neumann of King's College in London believes the Istanbul attacker was part of IS and that he was not acting alone. Neumann says he is unaware of any case in which someone has built a suicide belt of their own accord and then successfully deployed it. In addition, IS supporters cheered the attack in social media and the group still has an excellent infrastructure in Turkey.&#xA;Even if Turkey has stepped up its fight against IS, the terror militia is still active in the country. Only a short time ago, IS murdered two Syrian journalists in Sanliurfa, a city in southeastern Turkey. And just to the west, in Gaziantep, a Syrian documentary filmmaker was shot dead in front of a shopping center.&#xA;Plus, figures circulated by the Turkish government claiming 3,000 arrests in connection with anti-IS operations should also be viewed critically, warns a German intelligence source. Few of those arrested remain in detention, the source says, with the majority getting released quickly afterward.&#xA;Turkey's MIT secret service plays a particularly ambivalent role in anti-terror efforts. There are some indications suggesting MIT may have worked together with IS -- at least in the past. A weapons delivery in 2014 also raised suspicions that MIT may have been providing Syrian extremists with direct support.&#xA;At the time, an informant alerted Turkish security forces about a weapons delivery heading for Syria and a public prosecutor had the transport -- which was being accompanied by MIT agents -- searched. The Turkish government banned any news coverage and spoke of an &quot;aid delivery&quot; to Turkmen in the northwest of Syria. Video recordings, however, suggest they were carrying munitions. Government critics claim they were being sent to IS, but there is no evidence to prove that.&#xA;Can Turkey Be Trusted?&#xA;This puts Western intelligence services in a difficult position: Can the Turks be trusted?&#xA;Still, European diplomats in Turkey take information provided by MIT about potential IS terrorists seriously. For example, MIT has provided concrete information about possible terrorist attackers who are making their way to Europe or are already there. One diplomat, an expert on security issues, notes that Turkey maintains a &quot;network of informants in Syria and Iraq that should not be underestimated.&quot; Few other intelligence agencies have such good sources in the region. The source says the Turkish government has in fact &quot;perceptibly increased&quot; its efforts to combat IS during the last six months. Still, the source adds, doubts persist when it comes to Ankara's political agenda.&#xA;&quot;There's always a residual risk about whether Ankara is truly interested in fighting IS, or if it actually has secret sympathies -- either because it wants to use it as a means to weaken Assad or because, they feel closer to their fellow believers for religious reasons (as predominantly Sunni Muslims),&quot; the source says.&#xA;Other experts draw a less flattering comparison to Pakistan's ISI intelligence service. With ISI, too, they say, you never know which side it is actually on -- whether it is combatting or supporting the Taliban or doing both at the same time.&#xA;European diplomats also find it problematic that MIT was given additional responsibilities in 2014 such that it can now be used as a &quot;domestic policy instrument.&quot; The secret service now has much greater access to data from companies, banks and their customers. &quot;It is making life difficult for all people who are unpopular with the government,&quot; the diplomat says. He says this has also resulted in further incursions into press freedoms. Journalists who report on the intelligence agency's activities can now be subject to prosecution and stiff prison sentences because it can be claimed that they threaten security.&#xA;A Country with Ubiquitous Challenges&#xA;On top of all this is the fact that Turkey is simply overwhelmed. In southeastern Turkey, the army is fighting what is essentially a civil war against members of the Kurdish opposition and the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has attacked and killed security forces multiple times. The country has taken in millions of refugees from Syria. It is participating in the international alliance against IS. It has a 900-kilometer (559-mile) long border to Syria it has to guard. Add to all this the fact that it has to observe hundreds and perhaps even thousands of jihadists inside its own borders. If it didn't sound so cynical, one could almost say: What has happened was inevitable. And those who wanted to could have seen it coming long ago.&#xA;A little over a year ago, political scientist Behlül Özkan of Istanbul's Marmara University predicted rather precisely what might happen in the event of an attack. &quot;A few tourists die and that's the end of tourism, one of the most important pillars of our economy,&quot; he said. At the time, he was warning of the possibility of a single bombing attack at a hotel along the Mediterranean coast. Now, in winter, it appears that Istanbul's historical center made a more suitable place for targeting foreign tourists.&#xA;Turkey is dependent on tourism. Last year, the industry had just under $31 billion in revenues, with the greatest numbers of visitors coming from Russia and Germany. If vacationers were to avoid the country in the future, in addition to harming the tourism industry, it could also create tumult for a Turkish economy that is already experiencing difficulties.&#xA;Which helps explain why the country is now doing all it can to demonstrate strength. The army has begun shelling dozens of IS positions in Syria and Iraq with tanks and artillery, and it has arrested 74 suspected Islamic State members in Turkey. But swift success against the terrorist militia is unlikely. Security forces carried out raids against IS supporters right after the attack in Ankara as well. The state succeeded in disrupting the group's operations, but it didn't manage to destroy its structures. &quot;After years in which IS was able to build up a network in Turkey unhindered, the confrontation now will be protracted and difficult,&quot; predicts Turkey expert Stein.&#xA;Political Consequences for Germany&#xA;The attack in Istanbul could also impact refugee policy and, as such, have enormous political consequences for Germany. Just a few days ago, Ankara announced it would issue work visas to some of the 2.2 million Syrian refugees who have entered into the country since 2011. It's a step that would improve living conditions for refugees in Turkey and presumably help stem the flow to Germany. Now, some politicians in the Turkish government are questioning whether the step should be reversed.&#xA;But restrictions and animosity towards refugees in Turkey might intensify the exodus to Europe. And the Turkish government might be even less inclined to try to stop them from making the crossing to Greece. Against that backdrop, the German government will have to cooperate even more closely with Erdogan in the future, closing its eyes or looking the other way when it comes to critical questions about democracy, rule of law and the free press.&#xA;More than a hundred civilians have again perished in southeastern Turkey in recent weeks, curfews have been imposed in many cities and tens of thousands of Kurds have been expelled. The renewed escalation in the decades-long conflict has intensified polarization, opening a window of opportunity for the jihadists to play different ethnic groups off against each other and to exploit the anger of the oppressed and the marginalized.&#xA;Unfortunately, it looks as though Erdogan is going to grant them exactly the favor they would like to see. Following Tuesday's attack in Istanbul, the president gave a speech to Turkish diplomats. He thundered for a half an hour over an open letter signed by academics calling for peace in southeast Turkey -- and arrested several of the signatories on Friday -- and he lashed out against the PKK and the political opposition. And Erdogan also spoke about what happened in Istanbul. But just briefly. He only spent a little less than a minute talking about the attack. Apparently that's all he thought it was worth.&#xA;By Maik Baumgärtner, Jörg Diehl, Hasnain Kazim, Martin Knobbe, Juliane von Mittelstaedt, Maximilian Popp, Christoph Reuter, Sven Röbel, Fidelius Schmid, Charlotte Schmitz, Christoph Schult and Antje Windmann&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

But for the impact of the pound weakening against the dollar, UK revenues would have been up 20%.&#xA;Adding to the £3.7bn in British sales completed earlier in the year, Google&#x2019;s fourth-quarter revenues from the UK, took 2015 turnover from British advertisers to £5bn.&#xA;In after-hours trading, the share price for Alphabet, Google&#x2019;s parent company, immediately jumped 9%, implying a total stock market value for Alphabet of $568bn. That meant it eclipsed rival Californian tech firm Apple, which has a value of $535bn, making Alphabet the most valuable company in the world.&#xA;Related: Google tax deal was purely HMRC decision, Downing Street stresses&#xA;As chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, summarised the group&#x2019;s tax position, there was no mention of the £130m 10-year tax settlement with HMRC that has led to widespread outrage.&#xA;Instead, Porat highlighted that a better-than-expected settlement with the US tax authorities &#x2013; relating to separate multi-year dispute &#x2013; had seen the group&#x2019;s effective tax rate drop sharply during the last three months of the year.&#xA;Porat said that, as a result, the group&#x2019;s effective tax rate had been 17% for 2015, down from 19.3% in 2014. This compares with a headline tax rate of 35% in the US, the group&#x2019;s largest market, and a rate of 20% in the UK, its second biggest market.&#xA;Key to Google&#x2019;s low tax rate is the controversial and complex arrangements it uses to shift non-US income from the UK and elsewhere to Bermuda, using aggressive tax strategies known as the double Irish and the Dutch sandwich.&#xA;Much of Google income from the UK arrives in Ireland and is then squeezed through another Google company in the Netherlands before bouncing back to Ireland and Bermuda, a UK overseas territory and tax haven.&#xA;George Osborne had promised to stop multinationals diverting UK sales and profits overseas , but Google this month announced it had struck a deal with HMRC to continue the controversial arrangement.&#xA;The episode as initially claimed as a &#x201c;major success&#x201d; by Osborne, who introduced a tax on diverted profits last year. Many critics have since labelled it a &#x201c;sweetheart deal&#x201d; and even business minister Sajid Javid said it was &#x201c;not a glorious moment&#x201d;.&#xA;Related: Google settlement clears way for tech giants to strike deals with HMRC&#xA;The chancellor had said his diverted profits tax would force companies to unwind their complex tax structures which &#x201c; abuse the trust of the British people &#x201d;. As a consequence, the tax was dubbed &#x201c; the Google tax &#x201d;&#xA;Google&#x2019;s UK business paid tax of just £21m for 2013. The British company&#x2019;s soon-to-be-published latest accounts &#x2013; for the 18 months to June 2015 &#x2013; show it has agreed to pay back taxes and interest of £130m covering underpayments stretching back a decade.&#xA;As in previous years, 2015 after-tax profits from the UK and other non-US markets have further boost Google&#x2019;s Bermudan coffers in 2015.&#xA;The search group is shortly expected to confirm in its annual report that its cash mountain, parked in a company in the North Atlantic island, increased by $4bn to $43bn by the end of December .&#xA;Defending its UK tax settlement, Google has previously said: &#x201c;After a six-year audit by the tax authority we are paying the amount of tax that HMRC agrees we should pay. Governments make tax law, the tax authorities enforce the law and Google complies with the law.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

With a new annotated edition, Historians hope to &quot;defuse&quot; the Nazi-era bestseller. Even after seven decades, it remains a dangerous proposition.&#xA;That damned book! The minister feels a need to drink something spicy. Ludwig Spaenle reaches for a bottle of Tabasco, pours a generous amount into a glass of vegetable juice and takes a large gulp. &quot;Mein Kampf?&quot; Yes, he says, it's certainly a unique story.&#xA;He initially welcomed the new edition of Adolf Hitler's book, he says, and the Bavarian state parliament even approved a budget of 500,000 ($542,000) for the project, led by the Munich Institute of Contemporary History. But then, says Spaenle, he accompanied the Bavarian governor on a trip to Israel in September 2012. And after that, opinions changed, he explains. Period.&#xA;Spaenle, the Bavarian Minister of Education and Science, pours another serving of vegetable juice and Tabasco into his glass and takes another large gulp. What happened in Jerusalem? Well, he says, there were the victims' rights groups, there were Israeli cabinet ministers and there were many meetings. After that, it was clear that it just wouldn't do. A new edition of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; with the coat of arms of the State of Bavaria on the front cover? No one in Israel would have understood such a thing.&#xA;Spaenle takes another sip and spends a moment staring into space in his office, enormous even by Bavarian standards. It is an evening in November 2015 and the minister, a Baroque figure, is sitting -- or rather, holding court -- on his sofa, with his sleeves rolled up, surrounded by dark oil paintings on the walls and a large photo of former Bavarian Governor Franz Josef Strauss on his desk.&#xA;This book, the victims, academia -- somehow it all refused to fit together. And it was up to him, Spaenle, to solve the problem without spoiling his relationship with his boss, current Bavarian Governor Horst Seehofer.&#xA;On Dec 11, 2013, a day after Seehofer had announced Bavaria's withdrawal from the project, Spaenle wrote a rather sly press release: &quot;Out of respect&quot; for the victims of the Holocaust, he wrote, he too was opposed to the publication of &quot;an academic edition of this disgraceful book on assignment from the Free State of Bavaria.&quot; But then he added, diplomatically: &quot;This will not affect the freedom of academia to address the issues it deems necessary.&quot;&#xA;Sold Out&#xA;In other words, the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) was free to continue working on the project. The state government was not asking the IfZ to pay back the subsidy, instead the funding was declared to be a non-project-specific grant. The language allowed Spaenle to successfully evade the problem.&#xA;Now, more than two years later, the IfZ edition has actually been published. And just days after it appeared in bookstores last week, the first print run of 4,000 copies was sold out. IfZ is now starting a second, much larger run of the two-volume, 1,948-page work. The new edition includes the complete original text of &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; together with more than 3,500 astute annotations. The only thing missing is the Bavarian coat of arms on its gray cover. To defuse any suspicions of commercial interest, the edition is being published by the IfZ's in-house imprint.&#xA;Nevertheless, the project has raised concerns, even in the academic world. Wolfgang Benz, a Berlin expert on anti-Semitism, cannot imagine that the new edition will offer anything new, and Jeremy Adler, a professor of German in London, even tried to stop the edition last Thursday. Otherwise, he wrote in an angry op-ed in Süddeutsche Zeitung, &quot;a disgraceful work would gain a dignity that we associate with Homer and Plato, the Bible and the Talmud.&quot;&#xA;Adler does admit, however, that he rendered his verdict &quot;without access to the new text.&quot; Which is rather bold. For if he had had the opportunity to peruse the IfZ edition, he would most likely have reached a different conclusion. In fact, this edition is one of the most important Hitler-research works to be printed in years. It will satisfy experts in the field and provide historically interested laypersons with a wealth of new insights.&#xA;It is likely that IfZ historians have never before attracted this much public attention. For months, journalists, diplomats and politicians besieged the academics at their offices in a concrete building on Leonrodstrasse in Munich. Some of their more prominent visitors included Douglas Davidson, the US State Department's Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues, Dan Shaham, the Israeli General Consul in Munich, and members of the Green Party's parliamentary group in the Bavarian State Parliament.&#xA;The new edition project was mentioned on South Korean breakfast radio and on the BBC, CNN and Al Jazeera. The Italian daily La Stampa and the Spanish newspaper El País reported on the project, as did the Tokyo daily Asahi Shimbun and the New York Times. Three German public broadcasters produced documentaries and almost all German newspapers and magazines published lengthy articles on the subject.&#xA;'The Foundation of the Hitler Myth'&#xA;Should we have expected anything else? For the last 90 years, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; has been treated as a key work of Nazism and, in light of its consequences, can be considered the world's most dangerous book. It was only during the writing of the tome that Hitler began to believe that he had been chosen, and the book was intended to convey this message to his supporters. &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; says historian Ian Kershaw, laid &quot;the foundation for the Hitler myth.&quot;&#xA;In &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; Hitler outlined the murderous ideology that dominated his thinking until his 1945 death in the Führer bunker in Berlin. With the book, writes Hitler biographer Peter Longerich, Hitler began &quot;to consistently connect the space issue with the race issue,&quot; that is, the destruction of the Soviet Union with anti-Semitism. In the end, these delusional ideas led to the dual catastrophe of a war of extermination and the Holocaust.&#xA;From pogroms to hatred of Communists to his greatest obsession, the war, Hitler revealed in his book &quot;what he intended to do, with an openness that was as remarkable as it was naïve,&quot; write the IfZ historians. In the last relatively free parliamentary election before the war, in March 1933, about 52 percent of Germans voted for Hitler and his coalition. They should have known what the leader of the Nazi Party had in mind.&#xA;The first volume of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was published in the summer of 1925 and the second in December 1926. Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels called the book a &quot;gospel of a new era,&quot; while others saw it as the &quot;bible of National Socialism.&quot; Today critics are no less dramatic in their assessments, calling it a &quot;grail of evil&quot; and a &quot;Pandora's box&quot; that would better be left closed forever.&#xA;Once it was re-opened, Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Israeli Cultural Society of Munich, warned in the Washington Post, it could no longer be closed. In other words, Knobloch seemed to imply, a republication of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; could expose Germany to an uncontrollable threat.&#xA;It is a concern shared by many. Indeed, justice and interior ministers from the German states have prepared for the book's publication -- because the Munich academics aren't the only ones now allowed to publish &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; As of Jan. 1, 2016, anyone can publish and sell the book, at least in theory. More than 70 years after the author's death, the copyright, which the Free State of Bavaria held since 1948 and consistently defended, has now expired.&#xA;Aware of the Risks&#xA;But exactly how dangerous is &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; today? Will adherents of the anti-Islam group Pegida find new material for their agitation? Will a xenophobe like Björn Höcke, a politician with the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, use &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to justify his biological racism? Will Germany's latent anti-Semites -- about 20 percent of the population, according to polls -- immediately begin to invoke Hitler's book?&#xA;The publishers of the new edition are certainly aware of the risks. He is not willing to rule out, &quot;that sections of 'Mein Kampf' can still be exploited for radical right-wing thought today,&quot; says IfZ Director Andreas Wirsching. He cites the &quot;Statement on the Question of the Affinity of the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany) with Historic National Socialism,&quot; which his institute submitted for the newly launched proceedings to ban the neo-Nazi NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. Apparently, members of the new far right have repeatedly cited Hitler's book -- to legitimize political violence, for example, or to justify the myth of the &quot;Jewish desire for global dominance.&quot;&#xA;If the case against the NPD succeeds, Germany could find itself in a paradoxical situation this spring: with a newly banned neo-Nazi party at the same time that its ideological foundation is more widely available than it has been since 1945.&#xA;Nonetheless, Wirsching defends his institute's project. The fear &quot;of acting incorrectly from a moral standpoint or making political mistakes in the treatment of Hitler's legacy&quot; -- that is, continuing to pretend that the book doesn't exist -- would only amplify its taboo nature. &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; is &quot;eminently valuable as a source work in studying the history of the calamity,&quot; he says, noting that no work reveals more about the delusional world of Adolf Hitler.&#xA;The fact that the ideas underpinning this delusional world are neither unique nor original is one of the most important conclusions reached by the Munich historians. After examining hundreds of pamphlets and books from the volkisch-conservative world of the early 20th century, they determined that Hitler's apodictic verdicts and his biologistic terminology grew straight out of the reactionary mainstream.&#xA;The man who would later become Germany's &quot;Führer&quot; wasn't the only one who despised Slavs, hated Jews and bloviated about &quot;natural selection&quot; and the &quot;law of the jungle.&quot; In fact, the Nazi leader derived his ideas &quot;from the popular and pseudo-scientific knowledge of his day,&quot; especially social Darwinism, says IfZ Director Wirsching. What was unique, however, is the manner in which he assembled the pieces. According to Wirsching, Hitler &quot;integrated key elements of German political culture, amplifies them and radicalized them for his purposes.&quot;&#xA;Uncovering the Lies&#xA;What the IfZ scholars call this &quot;monstrosity&quot; has never been annotated -- and refuted -- so comprehensively. The historians compared 38 of the 1,122 editions of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; with one another. Each correction is noted. For instance, in the 1937 edition the phrase &quot;teure&quot; (expensive) German mothers was changed to &quot;treue&quot; (faithful) German mothers. It was changed back to &quot;teure&quot; mothers in 1939 and finally, in 1944, to &quot;treue&quot; mothers.&#xA;Most of all, however, the editors have uncovered every lie and half-truth. For instance, where Hitler writes that Jewish theater critics went easy on productions by Jewish authors, the editors quote from damning reviews by Karl Kraus, an Austrian Jewish critic, about works by Jewish playwrights. Where Hitler claims that &quot;nine-tenths of all literary filth&quot; was written by Jews, the IfZ team exposes the &quot;nine-tenths statement&quot; as a favorite trick of anti-Semites. No matter how many counter-examples are presented, they are merely interpreted by the far-right as exceptions that prove the rule.&#xA;Hitler, originally from the Austrian town of Braunau, deliberately distorted many things, while other inaccuracies were merely the result of poor research. The number of factual errors alone is in the hundreds. Hitler writes that the heirs to the Habsburg throne spoke Czech with each other. Wrong. He writes that he himself was Nazi Party member No. 7. Wrong again (the number on his membership card was 555). According to Hitler, &quot;no one&quot; was interested in the question of war debt after World War I. Completely wrong. Few issues were as controversial among Germans after 1918 as the war debt.&#xA;In fact, the editors' notes on some passages are what make them broadly comprehensible in the first place. The IfZ team, headed by historians Christian Hartmann and Thomas Vordermayer, applied all the rules of historiography in completely disassembling the original, 800-page text. In the new edition, each double page consists of one page from &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and one page filled with up to 15 explanatory comments from the publishers. Reading is tedious at times, but it's also rewarding: The new edition goes a long way toward permanently inoculating readers against the book's ideological poison. Or, to put it in the words of Christian Hartmann: &quot;We are the bomb disposal team. We remove the fuse.&quot;&#xA;Hitler's writing style feels outdated today. The text is replete with oddities (&quot;the lower strata of the population&quot;) and bizarre metaphors (&quot;Examples of the Columbus Egg lie around us in hundreds of thousands, but observers like Columbus are rare.&quot;).&#xA;Pride in Anti-Semitism&#xA;Hitler loved foreign words, repetition and superlatives. For him, parliaments were not only dishonest, but in fact &quot;most supremely dishonest,&quot; and his party didn't just face a struggle, but an &quot;enormous struggle.&quot; And then there is the constant vituperation of his enemies as &quot;profiteers,&quot; &quot;poisoners of the people,&quot; &quot;deceitful assassins,&quot; &quot;smug little men&quot; and &quot;riff-raff.&quot;&#xA;Another noticeable feature is Hitler's inflated use of terms that would ordinarily be negative, such as &quot;ruthless&quot; and &quot;brutal,&quot; in a positive context: &quot;From being a soft-hearted cosmopolitan I became an out-and-out anti-Semite,&quot; Hitler reported in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; -- and he was clearly proud of the transformation.&#xA;Astonishingly, the author, ordinarily not one for self-criticism, felt that his book was not particularly successful linguistically. &quot;I am not a man of the pen, and I write poorly,&quot; he noted in 1924. It was an assessment that even Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels, who was devoted to Hitler, shared. &quot;The book feels honest and courageous,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just that the style is sometimes unbearable.&quot;&#xA;Apparently, most readers did not find Hitler's strange style off-putting. Reviewers in the right-wing press praised the work. A pastor even thanked God &quot;for the hours in which I was able to study Adolf Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf.'&quot; The diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker, whose son would later serve as president of Germany, was apparently so impressed by the book that he praised Hitler's &quot;warm-heartedness toward social suffering&quot; in a letter.&#xA;Literary scholar Helmuth Kiesel, a professor of German literature in Heidelberg, notes that the book is -- linguistically, at least -- better than its reputation. In the summer before last, Kiesel performed an experiment and read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in its entirety during a vacation. He found the content disgusting, but Kiesel reached a surprising conclusion in an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where he noted that Hitler had a &quot;broad range of rhetorical and stylistic tools&quot; at his disposal. He was &quot;not incompetent, but a writer with an awareness of his impact.&quot;&#xA;Hitler's choice of words, the IfZ team notes, was certainly in keeping with the period. Some terms that are frowned upon today as being of Nazi provenance -- such as Volksgemeinschaft (ethnic community) and Entartung (degeneracy) -- were also used by democrats at the time.&#xA;Prepared for a 'Fantastical Adventure'&#xA;In the early 1920s, Germany was a hotbed of delusional ideas and political desperados. The German Empire had sent more than 13 million soldiers to war, and more than 2 million of them didn't come back. For many people, the &quot;stab-in-the-back legend,&quot; that is, the claim that primarily Jews, Social Democrats and Communists were responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, seemed to be the only explanation for the disaster. German society, traumatized by the defeat, lacked democratic consensus and center-right parties, together with the SPD on the center-left, had discredited themselves among large segments of the population by accepting the Treaty of Versailles.&#xA;Meanwhile, Leftist revolutionaries and radical right-wing militia groups took the country to the brink of civil war, while a judiciary that was hostile to the republic did almost nothing to stop their murderous activities. Political anti-Semitism, still the domain of smaller parties in the German Empire, expanded into the entire conservative, national spectrum.&#xA;Finally, the country and its inhabitants became impoverished following the hyperinflation of 1923. &quot;The year 1923 wore Germany out,&quot; wrote journalist and Nazi Party opponent Sebastian Haffner, &quot;and it prepared it not for Nazism in particular, but for any fantastical adventure.&quot; The thing that gave Nazism its &quot;streak of insanity&quot; developed at the time: &quot;The cold madness, the imperiously self-indulgent, and the blind determination to achieve the impossible.&quot;&#xA;Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler saw the war come to a close from a military hospital in Pasewalk. An Austrian fighting in a Bavarian unit, he had been temporarily blinded by a mustard gas attack. Like many other soldiers, he was searching for someone to blame for the defeat. Germany had fallen into the hands of a &quot;gang of despicable criminals,&quot; who were to be fought tooth and nail, he later wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; and he wanted to contribute to the fight. Then he added the famous and notorious sentence: &quot;For my part, I then decided that I would take up political work.&quot;&#xA;It is unlikely that the wounded war veteran truly envisioned a career in politics as early as November 1918. But he did soon make an impression on his comrades with his strident tirades of hate against Jews and Communists. In the summer of 1919, his superior, a radical right-wing officer, transferred him to a Reichswehr camp near Augsburg in Bavaria, where Hitler, as a propagandist, was to turn Spartacist soldiers into dedicated nationalists.&#xA;At the time, Bavaria was suffering from the consequences of the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which had plunged the state into chaos for several months. And because a few leaders of the socialist uprising were Jews, Hitler became convinced that Judaism and Bolshevism were inextricably linked.&#xA;'A Mouth We Could Use'&#xA;In September 1919, Hitler's right-wing officer sent him to Munich to attend a meeting of the German Workers' Party, one of the many small nationalist parties of the postwar era. Hitler's audience was so impressed by his first speech that party leader Anton Drexler reportedly shouted: &quot;Man, he's a got a mouth we could use.&quot;&#xA;Hitler enjoyed his appearances and turned his talent for rhetoric into a profession, speaking before increasingly large audiences. He vituperated against Versailles and social democracy, and he called Jews bloodsuckers and Communists traitors. And he soon took over the party, which had since been renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and began to plan an overthrow of the government. Inflation was reaching its climax and one kilo of bread cost 200 billion marks. From his base in Munich, he aimed to conquer Germany and deal a death blow to the Weimar Republic.&#xA;Logistically speaking, Hitler's coup, on the night of Nov. 8, 1923, was more of an amateur affair. He had neither sufficient troops nor a strategy to seize power in Berlin. During the final shootout between his followers -- many of them recruited from Munich beer halls -- and the police, a bullet missed him by a few centimeters and killed the man standing next to him.&#xA;In the ensuing trial, Hitler was sentenced to a five-years prison term, which he was permitted to serve with a handful of supporters in Landsberg am Lech. In the luxury prison, where the cellblock was furnished more like a middle-class apartment, inmate Hitler spent his days writing. At first, his only goal was to settle scores with all those he held responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I.&#xA;There are many myths about the creation of &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; for instance that the future Führer dictated his work to fellow Nazi inmate Rudolf Hess, who typed it up. In reality, Hitler typed it himself. And to get himself into the mood, he even engaged in a bit of reenactment. &quot;I can hear his voice in our joint living and dining room,&quot; Hess noted in a letter to his mother on May 17, 1924. &quot;He appears to be in the midst of reliving wartime experiences. He is imitating the sounds of shells and machine guns, and he is jumping wildly around the room, transported by his fantasy.&quot;&#xA;A few weeks later, Hitler was so intoxicated by his words that he burst into tears while reading the passages about his first deployment to the front in 1914.&#xA;Fervant Supporter&#xA;He frequently read passages from the developing book out loud to his fellow inmates. Publishers contacted him with offers. In the end, he signed a contract with the Eher publishing house, which also published the Völkischer Beobachter (National Observer), the Nazi Party paper. Affluent Hitler supporters from the Munich upper classes, including the wife of piano maker Carl Bechstein, sent him baskets of food. Hitler could also count on the prison warden, who was a fervent supporter of his famous inmate.&#xA;What Hitler had intended as a settling of scores soon became an odd mixture of stylized autobiography and ideological platform, a blend of party history and propaganda. In the preface to the first volume, Hitler writes that he wanted to &quot;clarify the goals of our movement&quot; and confront the creation of legends about him, allegedly by the Jewish press. But his real purpose was to differentiate the Nazi Party from other right-wing extremist parties, and to establish that there could only be one Führer: Adolf Hitler.&#xA;The demagogue devoted many pages to the &quot;magic power of the spoken word,&quot; which he argued was the only force capable of setting &quot;in motion great historical avalanches of religious and political movements.&quot; However, he added, an outstanding speaker is rarely a good theoretician and organizer at the same time, and that only the combination of these talents in a single individual could create &quot;a great man.&quot; Between the lines, Hitler left no doubt as to where this &quot;great man&quot; could be found: In the Landsberg prison, but only temporarily.&#xA;The book begins harmlessly enough. The 35-year-old author first writes about his family in Braunau am Inn, and about being rejected when he applied to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Despite not being accepted, he moved to Vienna in 1908, and according to &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; that was when &quot;the saddest period&quot; of his life began, a time of &quot;misfortune and misery.&quot;&#xA;He describes in drastic terms the alcoholism of many workers and the social hardships in Vienna, where ordinary families had already consumed the breadwinner's weekly wages after only three days. Hitler also claims that he was part of the squalor. &quot;Hunger was the faithful guardian which never left me.&quot;&#xA;That, though, was significantly overstated. Hitler regularly frequented Vienna coffee houses and spent his time strolling around the city, going to bars and concerts. The IfZ team confirmed research that he wasn't nearly as poor in his younger years as has sometimes been claimed. Thanks to money he had inherited from his mother, an orphan's pension and a loan from an aunt, he didn't have to work for an entire year. Only then did he earn an admittedly meager living painting postcards.&#xA;The story Hitler used to explain his early aversion to social democracy was also apparently invented. He claimed that he had worked as a casual laborer in construction. When his fellow workers went to a tavern, he always remained on the sidelines (&quot;I drank my bottle of milk and ate my morsel of bread&quot;). He claimed to have heard horrible things on the construction sites. The fatherland, religion and morality, he wrote, were all &quot;dragged through the mud.&quot; Hitler claimed he confronted the men and was then threatened by their leaders, who were Social Democrats, and told to get lost or else they would throw him from the scaffolding.&#xA;'Like a Maggot in a Putrescent Body'&#xA;It's a nice anecdote, but untrue, according to research conducted by the IfZ team. Adolf the construction worker &quot;probably never&quot; existed.&#xA;With accounts like these, Hitler sought to create the impression that Vienna had been the &quot;school&quot; of his life. Before then, he wrote, he had had nothing against Social Democrats, parliamentarianism or the Jews. It was only his own experiences that had disabused him of these notions, he claimed.&#xA;Hitler devoted only a few pages to describing his path to becoming a staunch anti-Semite. He was initially impressed by Vienna Mayor Karl Lueger, who was anti-Semitic, and then he took offence at the Eastern European Jews on the streets of Vienna. &quot;The odor of those people in caftans often used to make me feel ill,&quot; he wrote. A short time later, he arrived at the allegedly objective realization of the devastating impact of Judaism. &quot;Was there any shady undertaking, any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which at least one Jew did not participate? On putting the probing knife carefully to that kind of abscess, one immediately discovered, like a maggot in a putrescent body, a little Jew who was often blinded by the sudden light.&quot;&#xA;Passages like this permeate Hitler's bestseller like feverish rants. At irregular intervals, but with growing vehemence, the author rages against Judaism as the source of all evil. But his transformation into a hater of Jews, the future mass-murderer writes, was &quot;the occasion of the greatest inner revolution that I had yet experienced.&quot;&#xA;According to the Munich historians, Hitler claimed that this process took place about 10 years before it actually did. In fact, they write, it was not in Vienna but in Munich -- after the war -- that he, affected by defeat and revolution, became a &quot;dogmatic racial anti-Semite.&quot;&#xA;In its research, the IfZ team encountered the 1922 book &quot;Racial Science of the German People,&quot; by Freiburg eugenicist Hans F. K. Günther, which they believe inspired Hitler. According to Günther, the &quot;Nordic person&quot; has a tendency toward &quot;solitariness,&quot; and is forbidding, hard and relentless, highly talented but usually a poor student -- a characterization that closely matched the image Hitler had forged for himself.&#xA;It is no coincidence that Hitler mentioned neither patrons nor friends (of which there were indeed only a few), not even his sister Paula or other family members. The IfZ editors use the term &quot;systematic incompleteness&quot; to describe Hitler. By stylizing himself as an &quot;unknown individual,&quot; they write, he offered his followers an &quot;especially large potential to identify with him.&quot;&#xA;Even More Tedious&#xA;Hitler was inhibited and plagued by fears. In sticky, pubertal passages, he fabulates about prostitution, procreation as the purpose of marriage, and the &quot;female,&quot; whose psyche is influenced less by abstract reasoning than by a &quot;vague emotional longing for the strength that completes her being.&quot; There are classic rape fantasies, such as the tale of a &quot;black-haired Jewish youth&quot; who &quot;lies in wait for hours on end, satanically glaring at and spying on the unsuspicious girl whom he plans to seduce.&quot;&#xA;After about a third of the book, the reader has reached the year 1919, and reading becomes even more tedious. There are increasing numbers of race-baiting passages, and Hitler randomly strings together his theories. Chapter 10, for example, called &quot;Why the Second Reich Collapsed,&quot; is allegedly about the 1918 defeat. In it, he criticizes the supposed superiority of industry in the German Empire, berates the press, writes indignantly about the deterioration of cultural life, deplores the lack of contemporary monuments in cities, accuses the Reichstag of failure, finds fault with the fleet policy of Kaiser Wilhelm II and discusses the pros and cons of the monarchy.&#xA;Behind this chaotic panorama lies a concrete, misanthropic set of ideas, albeit one that is scattered across several chapters. He begins with the thesis that &quot;events that take place in the life of nations&quot; are &quot;the natural results of the effort to conserve and multiply the species and the race.&quot; Historical progress, he writes, is based on the struggle between the races, one in which the stronger prevail -- a law of nature, as Hitler claims. For Hitler, war is not a curse but a legitimate form of the &quot;great and eternal struggle for existence.&quot;&#xA;&quot;The pacifist-humanitarian idea,&quot; on the other hand, leads to &quot;barbarism&quot; and &quot;chaos.&quot; For Hitler, peace and the rule of law are not the achievements of civilization but signs of decline. The team of Munich researchers sees the roots of this anti-civilization program in Hitler's wartime experiences on the Western front, with which he never came to terms. &quot;The man writing these words is someone for whom the war never really ended,&quot; they write.&#xA;&quot;When the courage to fight for one's own health is no longer in evidence,&quot; Hitler declares in one passage, &quot;then the right to live in this world of struggle also ceases.&quot; Of course, he anticipates the outcome of the competitive struggle. &quot;Every manifestation of human culture  is almost exclusively the product of the Aryan creative power.&quot; And it is the duty of their noblest representatives, namely the Germans, to perform the historic mission to stop the Jews who, as &quot;the international maggot in the body of the nation,&quot; sought to control the world.&#xA;Dictatorship, Murder and War&#xA;To quote a term coined by historian Saul Friedländer, Hitler was a redemptive anti-Semite, which made him one of the racists who justified the persecution of the Jews as an act of idealism. In &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; he claims that humanity would perish if the Jews -- the &quot;vampire&quot; -- prevailed in the impending titanic battle between creation and destruction, good and evil. In Hitler's world of thought, Jews were determined to weaken other peoples, including Aryans, through racial &quot;cross-breeding.&quot; As soon as their powers of resistance were weakened, the Jews would first establish democracy and then, with the help of Marxism, the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot; In Hitler's view, the &quot;great, last revolution&quot; had already begun with the triumph of &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; in the Soviet Union. He argued that time was running out and advised his supporters to engage in an opposing effort that was as radical as it was brutal: dictatorship, murder and war.&#xA;In addition to analyzing Hitler's treatise, the IfZ historians engaged in a search for his sources. Hitler included neither footnotes nor a bibliography in his book. To the extent that this can be reconstructed today, it seems he haphazardly availed himself of the nationalist literature and the bestsellers of the day.&#xA;The ideological core of these sources can be found in the 11th chapter of the first volume of &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; titled &quot;Race and People.&quot; In addition to Günther's &quot;Racial Science of the German People,&quot; Hitler primarily used books by known anti-Semites like Henry Ford and Wilhelm Marr as well as the anti-Semitic classic &quot;The Foundations of the 19th Century,&quot; by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who claimed that the mixing of races would lead to &quot;decline&quot; and &quot;sterility.&quot;&#xA;There are analogies to Richard Wagner's essay &quot;Judaism in Music,&quot; in which Hitler, a fan of Wagner's, could read: &quot;The Jew can naturally but echo and imitate, and is perforce debarred from fluent expression and pure creative work.&quot; And Hitler's favorite author, Alfred Rosenberg, had written, in his pamphlet &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,&quot; that all revolutionary overthrows had been staged by Jews.&#xA;The idea of a large-scale land grab in the East had achieved popularity even before World War I. Hitler could read about it, for example, in a work by Heinrich Class, the head of the Pan-German League. Class advocated the colonization of the Slavic regions in the East in emulation of the Teutonic Knights of the Middle Ages.&#xA;IfZ co-publisher Roman Töppel has compiled an entire collection of documents and books that are unknown today but which left their mark on &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; as he explains in his essay &quot;Nation and Race,&quot; to be published soon in the Vierteljahrsheften für Zeitgeschichte (Contemporary History Quarterlies). &quot;It is conspicuous,&quot; says Töppel, &quot;that Hitler's arguments were considerably more one-sided and radical than those of most of the authors who influenced him.&quot; In other words, Hitler merely collected the building blocks for his work that suited him, while ignoring everything else. At the end of his &quot;Handbook of the Jewish Question,&quot; anti-Semite Theodor Fritsch writes that the &quot;Jewish question&quot; can only be solved by a &quot;sublimely brilliant mind with unlimited courage, the real dragon killer, the true Siegfried.&quot; Apparently the inmate at Landsberg Prison fancied himself in the role of this superhero.&#xA;A Political Platform?&#xA;But was there more to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; than just agitation against Jews and Communists? Was the book even a kind of political platform for the National Socialists? The historians at IfZ also explored this question and discovered a number of &quot;direct connections to the practical structures of National Socialism.&quot; In &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; for example, Hitler wrote:&#xA;-- That the &quot;first task&quot; of &quot;really national government&quot; is &quot;to seek and find those forces that were determined to wage a war of destruction against Marxism and to give those forces a free hand.&quot; By the summer of 1934 -- just one-and-a-half years after grabbing power -- the Nazis had locked up around 100,000 Social Democrats or communists in prisons, temporary detention centers and concentration camps.&#xA;-- That the &quot;people's state&quot; would classify its population in three groups: &quot;Citizens, subjects of the state and aliens,&quot; but that only &quot;citizens&quot; should be given all political rights. In 1935, the Nuremberg Laws determined that a &quot;Reich citizen can only be a person of German or German-related blood.&quot;&#xA;-- That those who &quot;show hereditary defects&quot; and invalids should be forcibly sterilized and that the &quot;people's state&quot; must ensure that &quot;only those who are healthy shall beget children.&quot; In July 1933, the &quot;Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring&quot; was passed and 400,000 people were forcibly sterilized.&#xA;-- That Aryans had the &quot;sacred duty&quot; to ensure that the &quot;purity of the racial blood should be guarded.&quot; In 1935, the so-called &quot;Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor&quot; went into effect, prohibiting marriages between Jews and non-Jews and penalizing any extramarital relations between them. That same year, the law was extended to ban marriage with &quot;gypsies, negroes and their bastards.&quot;&#xA;-- That the 80 million Germans Hitler counted in Europe should be united in one empire. Hitler included Austria is his calculations as well as the German-speaking minorities located largely in Poland and Czechoslovakia. By 1939, Hitler had subjugated these countries under his control.&#xA;-- That France should be considered the &quot;deadly enemy&quot; of the German people and that they must rally together for the &quot;last decisive contest&quot; with their neighboring country. The Wehrmacht invaded and occupied France in 1940.&#xA;-- That the Germans must be provided with Lebensraum, or greater living space, in the east but that &quot;Germanization&quot; can only be applied to land, and not to people. During World War II, General Plan Ost (Master Plan East) saw the expulsion and murder of 30 million Slavs.&#xA;'Pathetic Nonsense'&#xA;Those in 1925 who wanted to understand what Hitler stood for would have learned a lot from &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; But in upper middle class and leftist circles, the book wasn't taken seriously -- at least not initially. It was disparaged as &quot;pathetic nonsense,&quot; and full of &quot;sadistic&quot; drivel that made its author a laughing stock.&#xA;It was only much later that his opponents realized the explosive effect the book could have. &quot;Hitler is not a sneaky person at all,&quot; Social Democrat Friedrich Kellner noted in his diary on Dec. 12, 1944. &quot;In 'Mein Kampf,' he very openly expressed his most intimate thoughts.&quot;&#xA;Nevertheless, in the opinion of the historians at Munich's IfZ, the text cannot be read as the blueprint for the crimes of the &quot;Third Reich.&quot; The Holocaust, for example, the most horrifying of all of Hitler's crimes, isn't mentioned in &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; At most, he hints at his plans in a passage blaming the Jews for the defeat in 1918.&#xA;&quot;If twelve or fifteen thousand of these Jews who were corrupting the nation had been forced to submit to poison gas, just as hundreds of thousands of our best German workers from every social stratum and from every trade and calling had to face it in the field, then the millions of sacrifices made at the front would not have been in vain. On the contrary: If twelve thousand of these malefactors had been eliminated in proper time, probably the lives of a million decent men, who would be of value to Germany in the future, might have been saved.&quot;&#xA;What is referred to here, though, was death on the fighting front and not in a factory of extermination, so the quote does not deliver a hint at Auschwitz. Hitler and his supporters wanted to expel the Jews from all areas under German rule by 1941 and they weren't shy about using murder and terror to make this happen, but the systematic decimation of millions first came about as a consequence of the war against the Soviet Union.&#xA;When Hitler was working on &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; he still considered an endeavor like that to be implausible. In an interview he gave shortly before the putsch attempt in Munich, which appeared in a Catalan newspaper, he gushed about the medieval pogroms (which he called &quot;a magnificent thing&quot;) but added they wouldn't be feasible in Germany. &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; he said. &quot;Kill them all overnight? That, of course, would be the best solution and Germany would be saved. But it's not possible. The world would descend on us rather than thank us.&quot;&#xA;A Rich Man&#xA;At first, Hitler conducted himself cautiously. After his early release from prison in December 1924, he had to reform his desolate party and any further provocation, not to mention another putsch, seemed futile. Initially, the book didn't sell massively. It wasn't until the crises of the final days of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the National Socialist Party in elections that the tome's circulation increased dramatically. By the end of 1933, 1.5 million copies had been sold. But by 1945, sales of more than 12 million copies had made Hitler a rich man.&#xA;There has been much speculation about the number of people who have read the book. It appears that the number was smaller than the sales figures would seem to suggest, but was considerably larger than claimed following the end of the war. The historians at IfZ reference two polls conducted in the US occupation zone following the war. According to the surveys, taken in 1946, 23 percent of the respondents said they had read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; -- with 7 percent saying they read the book in its entirety and 16 percent claiming to have read parts of it.&#xA;If these figures are representative, it means that around 15 million Germans would have been familiar with the book. And millions of German citizens were familiar with parts of the treatise because members of the Hitler Youth, the SA and the SS were indoctrinated with quotes from &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot;&#xA;In 1945, the Allies banned the book. It was also placed on indexes of banned books in the Netherlands and in Russia, although Moscow didn't take the step until 2010. In France, Italy, Great Britain and many other countries, on the other hand, it is still printed and sold. Online reseller Amazon gives away any proceeds it earns from sales of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to charity.&#xA;The state of Bavaria fought against the distribution of the book internationally, but the tools available to it under copyright law were limited even prior to January 1. The book is a hit in the Arab world, in India and in Bangladesh -- and is popular in Turkey too, despite being banned there. These are all places where there's still enthusiasm for historical figures who, regardless of the calamities they have caused, have stuck it to the Jews or the United States.&#xA;Used bookstores, incidentally, are permitted to sell the book in most countries, even in Germany. Editions with an inscription from the &quot;Führer&quot; can even yield five-digit bids at auctions in the United States.&#xA;IfZ, which published Hitler's &quot;second book,&quot; a representation of his foreign policy goals never published during his lifetime, back in 1961, initially sought to bring out an annotated version of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in the 1990s. But the state of Bavaria refused to give its authorization at the time.&#xA;Use in Schools?&#xA;Even though the copyright barrier has now been lifted, no bookseller in Germany has stated it wants to stock the IfZ edition. Initially, the book will only be delivered to people who order it. Either way, IfZ has control over sales since the book is the product of its own imprint. Should the institute desire, they can ensure that &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; doesn't make it onto any bestseller lists, despite the considerable demand.&#xA;The German Teachers' Association, for its part, is in favor of using the book in classrooms. Bavarian state Education Minister Spaenle, though, doesn't yet want to make a decision on whether to approve an edition for schools.&#xA;It's questionable whether other editions will also be published. Germany's national panel of state justice ministers agreed in June 2014 that it should take steps to &quot;prevent the unannotated dissemination of Hitler's 'Mein Kampf,' even after its copyright period has expired.&quot;&#xA;Their decision is based on a German law that makes incitement a crime and that freedom of speech must take a back seat. It's unlikely that any German court would dispute that &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; has elements of incitement. The attempt to disseminate writings aimed at incitement alone is grounds for prosecution in Germany. The courts are likely just waiting for any publisher that would dare to try to bring out a non-annotated edition. Officials in Bavaria's Justice Ministry say action would be taken &quot;very quickly.&quot;&#xA;If they did dare, they would have plenty of time to study the Institute for Contemporary History's 1,948-page edition. Conviction on incitement charges in Germany can carry a sentence of up to five years in prison.&#xA;Article...&#xA;"/>

There were &#x201c;tens of thousands of individuals&#x201d; living in households which were on waiting lists for social housing with many others facing the risk of losing their home as a result of long-term mortgage arrears.&#xA;A policy of the last 20 years of relying on the private rented sector to meet social housing needs had proven &#x201c;a dismal failure&#x201d;.

However, such posters cannot be used on O&#x2019;Connell Street, Grafton Street and Henry Street.&#xA;Ministers have been told the election will be called on Wednesday. Enda Kenny has already told party figures the campaign will be three weeks long and will be the shortest in the history of the State.&#xA;Posters for the election may not be erected until the Polling Day Order is made by the Minister for the Environment which cannot be made before the election is called.&#xA;A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said he expected the order to be made the same day the Taoiseach announces the election.&#xA;Mr Kenny is expected to make the announcement in the Dáil before travelling to Áras an Uachtaráin where he will formally request that President Michael D Higgins dissolves the 31st Dáil.&#xA;ESB has warned candidates in the upcoming general election of the &#x201c;serious safety risk&#x201d; of erecting posters on wood or steel electricity poles.&#xA;A statement from ESB networks said serious injuries had been caused by members of the public who had come in close proximity to electricity wires and that using ladders and hoists to access electricity poles could result in death.&#xA;&#x201c;Attaching posters low down or interfering in any way with electricity poles, such as drilling or hammering is dangerous and is not permitted,&#x201d; it added.&#xA;Dublin City Council has called on campaigners to erect posters at a minimum height of 2.3m above footpaths, cycle tracks and pedestrian zone and has warned that posters must not &#x201c;obscure statutory road signs of traffic/pedestrian signals in any way&#x201d;.

The threat of violence was greatest in male prisons with their culture of &#x201c;hyper-masculinity&#x201d;.&#xA;Researcher Tanya Serisier said it was important that in seeking to protect LGBT prisoners, segregation did not become the &#x201c;default option&#x201d;.&#xA;The authors of the report, Out on the Inside, recommended that the Irish Prison Service explicitly considered and address the needs of LGBT prisoners as part of overall prisoner management, response and welfare.&#xA;The service, working the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (Glen), does have a programme for assisting gay people who work in prisons.&#xA;Patrick, a gay inmate who spoke to the researchers, said his experience of homophobic harassment from other prisoners, and the response from staff when he complained about it, was &#x201c;deeply traumatising, dehumanising, and degrading&#x201d;, and led him to hide his sexual identity. However Damien, a bisexual inmate, said that he he reported threats of violence to his prison governor, the response was supportive.&#xA;The researchers said that while single-cell accommodation should be the norm in prisons, it was particularly necessary for LGBT prisoners.&#xA;Speaking from the floor at the launch of the report, Feargal Black , director of care and rehabilitation with the Irish Prison Service, said dealing with the issues raised in the report would be &#x201c;challenging&#x201d; and that to say anything different would be unfair. He said that in his eight years in the prison service, he had dealt with two transgender prisoners.&#xA;Broden Giambrone of Transgender Equality Network, said that since the Gender Recognition Act 2015 people can self-determine their gender by way of a statutory declaration, yet the prison service allocated people to male and female prisons based on their genitalia or their birth certificates. In the UK a transgender woman sent to a male prison had recently killed herself.&#xA;Brian Sheehan of Glen said LGBT people had to struggle with their identities, and then found they had to hide their sexual identity if they were sent to prison.&#xA;However he said the report, and the work the prison service was doing with Glen, were both signs of how conditions in Ireland were improving for the LGBT community.&#xA;The authors of the report were: Dr Nicola Carr , Dr Siobhán McAlister, and Dr Serisier, all of Queen&#x2019;s University, Belfast. The research was supported by the Community Foundation of Ireland.&#xA;   &#xA;"/>

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill/The Irish Times.&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has said the abolition of the Special Criminal Court is one of his party&#x2019;s &#x201c;key objectives&#x201d; but may not appear in its general election manifesto.&#xA;Mr Adams has been critical of the non-jury court on a number of occasions, most recently following the conviction of prominent republican Thomas &#x2018;Slab&#x2019; Murphy for tax offences.&#xA;The court was established to prosecute cases involving criminal and paramilitary type offences where there were fears a jury could face intimidation. Mr Adams argued that Murphy, who he called a &#x201c;good republican&#x201d;, should have been tried before a jury of his peers. Murphy is due to be sentenced shortly.&#xA;Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Adams said the court &#x201c;runs against the whole thrust of the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;Whether (abolition) is in our manifesto or not is another issue or not. It certainly is one of our key objectives,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have not closed our manifesto.&#x201d;&#xA;Mr Adams was speaking ahead of a BBC Spotlight documentary on Murphy being aired on Tuesday night.&#xA;Mr Murphy, a former senior IRA member, was convicted of tax evasion by the court for failing to furnish tax returns for nearly a decade.&#xA;Mr Adams said the party was not concerned the programme would damage it ahead of the general election.&#xA;&#x201c;People are very sensible about all of these matters. We have a positive record in both parts of the island,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We are going forward with progressive policies and are based on core republican values.&#x201d;&#xA;Asked if he would still call Mr Murphy a &#x201c;good republican&#x201d; if jailed by the Special Criminal Court, Mr Adams replied: &#x201c;Lets wait until the judge has its say.

Photograph: Courts Collins&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;A Co Dublin woman who has climbed in the Himalayas and been to base camp on Mount Everest is suing the Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) for &#x20ac;60,000 in damages following a fall on the Wicklow Way.&#xA;Hill walker Teresa Wall (59) of Rathingle Cottages, Swords, said in the Circuit Civil Court that as the result of a laceration to her right knee she can no longer climb or run marathons.&#xA;The woman, who weekly ran a half-marathon as a hobby, told her barrister Peter McParland that she received seven stitches after falling on a board-walk in the Wicklow Mountains National Park.&#xA;She said her foot snagged in a hole in one of a number of old railway sleepers that made up an EU ground conservation boardwalk just below the JB Malone memorial on the Sally Gap to Djouce trail.&#xA;The court heard that although there had been hundreds of falls over the years in the country&#x2019;s national parks this was the first in which the NPWS had been sued for negligence and breach of duty.&#xA;Mr McParland said the wooden walkway constituted &#x201c;a structure&#x201d; and the Occupiers Liability Act imposed a much higher duty of care in the maintenance and management of it.&#xA;Kevin D&#x2019;Arcy, counsel for the State Claims Agency , said Ms Wall had voluntarily participated in a unique rugged sporting activity of known reasonable risks and the NPWS was entitled to rely on the doctrine of volente non fit injuria.&#xA;Mr D&#x2019;Arcy said the defendant denied negligence or breach of duty and, in the event of a finding against it, pleaded contributory negligence on the part of Ms Wall.&#xA;Ms Wall said she had been hill walking for 40 years and had walked &#x201c;all around the world&#x201d; with her husband. On August 6th 2013 they were coming down the mountain after a 20-mile-plus walk when they &#x201c;obeyed the laws of the mountain&#x201d; by following a sign which directed hikers onto the boardwalk.&#xA;She said she fell forward and lacerated her knee on a rusty nail. Her husband helped her off the mountain and brought her to the VHI Swiftcare Clinic in Swords where she received a tetanus injection and seven stitches.&#xA;Ms Wall said the boardwalk was in a disgraceful state. Since the fall, she said she has been inhibited in her work and social enjoyment of life.&#xA;Forensic engineer Pat Culleton said a single sleeper had rotted away at the point where steel cleats had once attached the rail line to it. He said walkers were deliberately steered on to the boardwalks.&#xA;Enda Mullan , District Conservation Officer for the park, said that in 20 years she had never had a complaint relating to a any fall on the Wicklow Way.&#xA;Two outdoor recreation consultants who walked the mountain path on two occasions each said it was for purpose.&#xA;Paul Romeril, forensic engineer for the defence, said there was a 100mm wide hole on the sleeper but he did not accept it created a hazard.&#xA;Cormac McDonnell, National Trails Office Manager for Sport Ireland said he had recently walked the boardwalks and had found them &#x201c;extremely robust, durable and fit for purpose&#x201d;.&#xA;Wesley Atkinson, regional manager with the NPWS, told Mr D&#x2019;Arcy he was a trained mountaineer and international hill walker. There was an annual footfall of 30,000 on the Wicklow Way and it was planned from May to begin replacing railway sleepers on boardwalks with pressure treated timber.&#xA;He said the work would be expensive as some of the new timbers would have to be flown in by helicopter and the old sleepers removed by air. Railway sleepers had a finite shelf life and it was expected the new timbers could be used for 30 years or more.&#xA;"/>

File photograph: Alan Betson&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;The Garda Representative Association (GRA) has lost an appeal over the introduction of changed regulations on sick pay in March 2014.&#xA;A three-judge Court of Appeal dismissed the GRA&#x2019;s appeal against an October 2014 decision of the High Court rejecting its challenge against the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin.&#xA;It also dismissed a cross-appeal by the Minister over the decision not to award costs against the GRA.&#xA;The GRA claimed the regulations were in breach of fair procedures and/or of its legitimate expectation.&#xA;It said Mr Howlin did not have the power the make the regulations without providing a derogation for the GRA, as gardaí had always been treated more favourably than other public servants under the previous sick leave regime due to the nature of the job.&#xA;The GRA said it was given an assurance, amounting to legitimate expectation, that the regulations would not come in prior to the conclusion of negotiations which were due to conclude in June 2014.&#xA;The Minister rejected the case for a derogation and said there was sufficient time for consultation.&#xA;Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan said the law under which the regulations were introduced meant the Minister was exercising &#x201c;what is truly a delegated legislative power&#x201d;.&#xA;She accepted the the power could only be exercised in relation to public servants, but said &#x201c;public servants&#x201d; include a broad range of people.&#xA;The Oireachtas clearly envisaged in the power it gave to the Minister that the regulations to be made were &#x201c;intended to diminish the then current entitlement of public servants to sick pay&#x201d;.&#xA;The Minister is obliged to balance the financial situation with the need to protect the health of public servants who are unable to work due to illness or injury.&#xA;The decision as to how to balance these matters involves policy considerations, she said.&#xA;In relation to the complaint over consultation about the changes, Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan said: &#x201c;The court is only concerned with obligations imposed by law on the respondents to consult.&#x201d;&#xA;The Minister had other considerations, including industrial relations issues, which he properly took into account, she said.&#xA;She said the GRA was on notice since 2012 of the intention to introduce public service-wide sick pay reforms.&#xA;It was also informed of a Labour Court recommendation that the regulations be introduced across the public service generally.&#xA;While there were failures to communicate a change in relation to gardaí, by January 2014, the draft regulations expressly included gardaí.&#xA;Mr Justice Gerard Hogan said while the GRA was understandably aggrieved, this did not give any legal ground of objection as to how the rules were brought in.&#xA;In relation legitimate expectation, he said any such expectation could not prevail in view of the law which brought in the regulations.&#xA;   &#xA;"/>

Screengrab photograph: Oireachtas TV&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;The chief executive of the HSE has acknowledged the organisation mishandled the issuing of an &#x201c;important apology&#x201d; to a woman known as &#x201c;Grace&#x201d; who is at the centre of an abuse controversy surrounding a foster home in the southeast region.&#xA;Tony O&#x2019;Brien told the Public Accounts Committee a view was taken in the HSE that an apology should be given to Grace, who has severe intellectual disabilities and is non-verbal, in person rather than by letter.&#xA;&#x201c;With this change in the mode of communication in the case of Grace it is now evident that the official HSE apology that was intended to be issued to Grace and to her mother was not made at that time,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;Live Stream&#xA;HSE chief Tony O'Brien's statement to PAC&#xA;&#x201c;Unfortunately, the desire to offer a formal HSE apology was lost in the communication to the staff members who were to conduct the meeting in person with Grace.&#x201d;&#xA;Accused of lying&#xA;Members of the committee last week accused the HSE of lying about providing an apology to Grace and Mr O&#x2019;Brien has been brought before it to discuss the matter.&#xA;He said that having personally reviewed the situation with the staff involved, he was &#x201c;satisfied that it was the intention to offer a full and frank apology to Grace&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;I wish to confirm that the HSE has since apologised officially to Grace and her mother. This official apology has been made by the Chief Officer both in person and in writing, with the assistance of the professionals now caring for her,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;Mr O&#x2019;Brien said he had written to the 44 families who had relatives placed in the foster home between 1983 and 2013 to say he was unhappy with how the HSE mishandled the apology and also to say he was sorry for any distress the issues revealed in recent weeks has caused them.&#xA;Garda investigations&#xA;He said it was clear from two unpublished reports into matters surrounding the foster home - which cannot be made public due to ongoing Garda investigations - that &#x201c;there were significant failings in the care provided by that foster family and significant failures by the former Health Board (and subsequently the HSE) to make the situation safe&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;For this, I offered them and their family member a full, sincere and heartfelt apology,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;Mr O&#x2019;Brien said that following media reports on the case, the HSE sought reassurance at a local level that an apology had been offered and a report provided confirming one had been.&#xA;&#x201c;However, it is the case that the assurance given to the chief officer, which she in turn passed upwards, referred to &#x2018;an individual expression of regret&#x2019; of the senior staff members to Grace and her mother,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;&#x201c;This expression of regret was then mistakenly taken as confirmation of an official apology on behalf of the HSE.&#x201d;&#xA;Mr O&#x2019;Brien offered &#x201c;an unreserved apology to the Public Accounts Committee and its members for submitting a document that contained erroneous information at that time&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;I want to assure you that having met the principals involved I am satisfied that there was no intention to mislead the committee.&#x201d;&#xA;Minister of State at the Department of Health Kathleen Lynch on Monday evening announced the formal establishment of a commission of investigation into allegations of abuse at the foster home.&#xA;Next government&#xA;With an election set to be called, she said, the inquiry would be a matter for the next government, once preparatory work by a senior counsel is complete.&#xA;Mr O&#x2019;Brien said he welcomed such a commission &#x201c;as it would provide a statutory mechanism in order to conclude this drawn-out process and allow the 47 service-users, their families and other interested parties to get answers to the questions that they have been asking for many years&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;Before I address those issues, I wish to place on the record that I met both Ministers Varadkar and Lynch yesterday during which we discussed the recommendation to Government for the establishment of a commission of investigation into this matter,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;   &#xA;"/>

Photograph: Courts Collins.&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;Fianna Fáil activist Brian Mohan has lost his legal challenge to laws linking the State&#x2019;s funding of political parties to their meeting specified gender quota targets.&#xA;An appeal is expected to be brought over the rejection of his challenge, his lawyers have indicated.&#xA;Mr Mohan challenged provisions of the Electoral (Political Funding) Act 2012, which halves the State funding of parties who fail to ensure at least 30 per cent of their general election candidates are women and 30 per cent are men. That percentage is intended to rise to 40 per cent after seven years.&#xA;In his reserved judgment on Tuesday, Mr Justice David Keane dismissed the challenge on grounds including Mr Mohan had failed to prove his claim a 50 per cent cut in funding for Fianna Fáil if it did not meet the gender quota targets would make it impossible for the party to function.&#xA;Mr Mohan also failed to show his exclusion from being considered for selection at the Dublin Central election convention last year was due to a decision imposed on the party as a result of the 2012 Act rather than a voluntary decision of Fianna Fáil, the judge said.&#xA;Bill welcomed&#xA;Fianna Fáil had appeared to welcome the 2012 Bill when it was introduced, he said. The party&#x2019;s then Senator, Averil Power, had described quotas as a &#x201c;necessary evil&#x201d; in a &#x201c;fundamentally flawed&#x201d; system where insufficient women were being selected as candidates , the judge noted.&#xA;Fiann Fáil justice spokesman Niall Collins had also proposed an amendment which would have extended the gender quota requirements to local elections, and, after that was defeated, the party introduced a voluntary gender quota in the 2014 local elections, he noted.&#xA;All the issues raised by Mr Mohan were ones that Fianna Fáil, rather than Mr Mohan, was best placed to address, the judge said. That raised issues as to whether Mr Mohan had the necessary legal standing to bring the case.&#xA;He ruled Mr Mohan did not have the necessary standing to bring the case. He made that decision on grounds including Mr Mohan could not assert his rights to stand as a candidate were affected because he had failed to adduce evidence to show the 2012 Act had mandated the directive to the Dublin Central selection convention. He said Mr Mohan&#x2019;s side had argued during the case the gender quota law could lead, for example, to a party comprising only women. He did not consider it was appropriate to allow Mr Mohan pursue such hypothetical arguments when he had failed to demonstrate any of his interests had been adversely affected by the Act.&#xA;There was no countervailing consideration to justify departure from the normal rules governing legal standing to advance claims, he added.&#xA;Mr Mohan, a student at DCU and part-time barman, was in court for the ruling. He brought the case against the State after Fianna Fáil directed last September its sole general election candidate in the Dublin Central constituency, where Mr Mohan, wished to go forward for selection, must be a woman. Mary Fitzpatrick has been selected.&#xA;Representation&#xA;The direction was issued after it emerged that, by summer 2015, there were 10 women among 47 candidates chosen for Fianna Fáil in 31 constituencies. The court also heard Ireland ranks 86th of 140 countries in relation to political representation of women who comprise 51 per cent of the Irish population and 15.1 per cent of the Dáil.&#xA;Mr Mohan argued the Constitution does not entitle the legislature to sanction parties over failure to select particular types of people to contest general elections. He also argued Fianna Fáil policy is decided by its ardfheis which had never approved gender quotas. His party cannot be coerced by law into imposing gender quotas which prevented him going forward as a candidate by reason of his gender, he claimed.&#xA;He told the court he is personally opposed to voluntary gender quotas. Because Fianna Fail would be penalised unless it met the gender quotas, he and all other ordinary members of the party would be affected and that gave him clear legal standing to bring this case, he argued.&#xA;The State argued its entitlement to enact laws regulating elections included an entitlement to legislate to promote the constitutional guarantee of equality. During the hearing, Dr Fiona Buckley of University College Cork, who has written extensively on gender and politics, expressed the view financial sanctions were &#x201c;probably the only option&#x201d; for getting Irish political parties to reach quotas aimed at having them run more women candidates in general elections.&#xA;   &#xA;"/>

Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;The Irish winner of Friday night&#x2019;s shared &#x20ac;132 million EuroMillions jackpot will have to wait till the end of the week before the money is pooled from around Europe and arrives in Ireland.&#xA;The Irish jackpot winner, who has contacted the National Lottery, will receive &#x20ac;66.19 million. The second winning ticket was sold in France .&#xA;National Lottery chief executive Dermot Griffin said the winner would be given some &#x201c;time and space&#x201d; before coming into the head office to claim the prize in person.&#xA;Speaking to RTÉ Morning Ireland he said the office would not identify where in Ireland the winning ticket was sold.&#xA;&#x201c;We were able to talk to them and take them through some of the advice we give to winners, particularly for this amount of money,&#x201d; said Mr Griffin after his office received a call from the winner.&#xA;&#x201c;What we do on a big win like this is we give them a little bit of time and space, certainly people might want to contact other family friends, relations or even advice from solicitors or accountants. We wouldn&#x2019;t identify a particular area on a win of this magnitude.&#x201d;&#xA;He said it was not yet clear whether the prize had been won by one person or by a syndicate.&#xA;&#x201c;We spoke to one person on the phone but then again they can represent a syndicate or they represent the family syndicate or they could be on their own. We just don&#x2019;t know at this stage,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;The National Lottery advised the winner to sign his or her name on the back of the ticket and keep it safe.&#xA;&#x201c;When you become a multi-millionaire in the space of one night it takes a bit of getting used to, but we&#x2019;re there to help them and no doubt we&#x2019;ll be in contact with them certainly over the next few days. We&#x2019;ll give them a little bit of time and advice and they can make their arrangements to come in and pick up the big cheque.&#x201d;&#xA;The claimant must attend National Lottery headquarters in person within 90 days of the date of the draw to officially claim the prize.&#xA;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty of time to decide when it suits them to come in and collect the money,&#x201d; said Mr Griffin. &#x201c;. . . you have to remember this is a game played in nine other countries and the jackpots are pooled, so there&#x2019;s a process around collecting that money.&#xA;&#x201c;It would certainly be the end of this week before the money arrives in Ireland for us to be able to pay it out to the winners.&#x201d;&#xA;EuroMillions is played in nine countries &#x2013; Austria , Belgium , France, Ireland, Luxembourg , Portugal , Spain , Switzerland and the UK.&#xA;Mr Griffin says the winner will be given a booklet and shown a video when they arrive to pick up their prize money.&#xA;He said the video gives winners advice about tax and some advice in terms of getting good professional assistance.&#xA;At least 91,000 people won prizes in last Friday&#x2019;s &#x20ac;132 million EuroMillions, he added.&#xA;Meanwhile, the National Lottery is calling for the Dublin winner of &#x20ac;1,000,000 to come forward and collect their prize. The winning ticket was sold at the Bus Stop Kiosk in Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 on November 9th, 2015.&#xA;In September 2014, a jackpot worth &#x20ac;86.7 million was won by a syndicate in Dublin. In July 2013, one Irish winner won a jackpot of almost &#x20ac;94 million but chose to remain anonymous.&#xA;Dolores McNamara holds the record for the largest ever win. The Co Limerick woman scooped more than &#x20ac;115 million in 2005.&#xA;   &#xA;"/>

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill/The Irish Times&#xA;   &#xA; &#xA; &#xA;One of the skills required of a political journalist is knowing when and how to make predictions.&#xA;Such tasks including calling the date of an election, predicting the outcome of a scandal, or making a clandestine infiltration into the mind of the serving Taoiseach.&#xA;What are the necessary attributes required? A tongue in good working condition and a neck manufactured out of the same metallic material as a tuba.&#xA;It&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#xA;As ridiculous as Apple&#x2019;s profit growth continuing at &#x2018;mad per cent&#x2019; every year into perpetuity.&#xA;As ridiculous as parroting out the hackneyed George Santayana quote even though you are not sure what it really means.&#xA;As ridiculous as expecting Galway to win the Liam McCarthy every year even though it&#x2019;s nearly 30 years since they last did it.&#xA;As ridiculous as an opinion poll somehow being able to tell us precisely that such-and-such is going to take the last seat in Kerry or in Dublin Bay North.&#xA;It&#x2019;s banal, but we still all buy into this myth-making as if it were fact.&#xA;Every political correspondent has already called this election before the stalls have even opened.&#xA;To paraphrase my latest political guru, Mary Cowen , we are not even elected yet and here we are already deciding what the next government is going to be.&#xA;My task this morning (see the story here) was to write a story with two potentially fatal variables in it. It was deceptively simple.&#xA;Taoiseach confirms he will dissolve Dail tomorrow&#xA;The first question was: Is Enda Kenny going to call the election today or tomorrow?&#xA;The second question was: Is the election going to be held on Thursday the 25th or Friday the 26th of February?&#xA;Both were tricky, especially if I got either call wrong. I rang and texted all the people I could using my chirpiest chummiest manner.&#xA;No-one really knew but all had hunches.&#xA;I had my own hunch too. Was it based on my years of accumulated skill, nous and judgement? Not at all. It was based on a hunch, the same one I had last week when I thought that my ticket would come good for that EUR14 million Lottery jackpot.&#xA;Of course, when carefully drafting the story, I gave myself a few get-out clauses so as not to make myself look too silly (we got a bit giddy, after all, when predicting a November election).&#xA;For what it&#x2019;s worth, I think Enda Kenny will make the announcement today for a Friday election.&#xA;That prediction might be tempered a little by the last meeting of Fine Gael ministers last night, where some got the impression he might hold off until Wednesday.&#xA;I might just be right but that will be down to luck more than anything else. And of course my great sagacity.&#xA;Another commission of investigation?&#xA;The last Cabinet meeting this morning should have had the lightest agenda possible.&#xA;Up until yesterday morning it consisted of three ambassadorial appointments and a number of promotions in the Defence Forces . I kid you not.&#xA;And of course, the last-minute instructions to the Cabinet on how to fasten their parachutes.&#xA;Instead, ministers will have a matter of real gravity to consider. They must decide if they should establish a commission of investigation into allegations of abuse at a former foster home in the south-east.&#xA;Minister for State Kathleen Lynch yesterday said at a press conference she will ask the Cabinet on Tuesday to establish a statutory inquiry into alleged events in the foster home.&#xA;Here is Kitty Holland and Fiach Kelly&#x2019;s report on the latest developments.&#xA;A lawyer, Conor Dignam SC, has already began work on what amounts to a scoping report for the terms of reference. He is expected to report by April.&#xA;The details of the case are terrible and fills one with feelings of sadness and desolation.&#xA;It concerns the abuse of a young woman known as Grace who had an intellectual disability and was placed in the home by the HSE in 1989.&#xA;She remained in the home for 13 years after allegations of abuse first came to light in 1996 only being removed in 2009. She is said to have suffered serial abuse.&#xA;It raises disquieting questions about failures in the HSE at operational, oversight, and supervisory, levels. How could such a situation have been allowed persist? For so many years?&#xA;The PAC is due to discuss the HSE report on the matter at noon today but that may be overtaken by the Government decision.&#xA;The basis for ordering some commissions and judicial inquiries during this Government&#x2019;s term has been sketchy indeed. Although this is occurring on probably this Government&#x2019;s last day, this investigation will be fully justified&#xA;   &#xA;"/>

In 1990, a sweeping NLD victory at the polls was annulled by the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in her family&#x2019;s villa by Yangon&#x2019;s Inya lake, together with many of her allies.&#xA;On Monday, with jasmine flowers in her hair and the party&#x2019;s peacock pattern on her longyi dress, Aung San Suu Kyi watched quietly as her choice of speaker and deputy speaker were installed.&#xA;In the wake of the November election win , she warned supporters to be humble and remain wary of the military&#x2019;s tendency to intervene when it feels threatened.But on Monday, U Win Htein, a party spokesman who spent years in prison himself, struck an optimistic note. &#x201c;We have been struggling for democracy since 1988,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have suffered very much but now we see the results and the fruits of our suffering. It is a beautiful beginning.&#x201d;&#xA;Win Htein said there were 110 former political prisoners among the 390 NLD candidates elected to both houses of parliament. Their jail terms often spanned more than two decades. Many were released only a few years ago, when power was handed over to a semi-civilian reformist government backed by the military and led by the president, Thein Sein. Those reforms led to the November election.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Aung San Suu Kyi at the first session of the new parliament. Photograph: U Aung/Xinhua Press/Corbis&#xA;In parliament on Monday, officials from the military &#x2013; which is granted a quarter of the seats in accordance to the junta-drafted constitution &#x2013; were seated in light green on the right side of parliament. While most seats were taken by the NLD, also present were representatives from ethnic parties who had won constituencies: men and women wearing hats and colourful jackets from the northern states of Kachin and Shan, or the simple Burmese longyi skirt in different patterns.&#xA;NLD member Ma Thandar, who spent six years in prison, joined other MPs in the lower house. &#x201c;It is a wonderful feeling to be here. I want to fight for the people, for their human rights,&#x201d; she told the Guardian.&#xA;Her husband, a journalist, was shot dead while in army custody in 2014.&#x201c;I miss my husband and his spirit will be here with me,&#x201d; she said.&#xA;Ma Thandar is set to work with the same people she accuses of taking her husband&#x2019;s life, but said she had no hate. &#x201c;I want to work together for the good of the country. I can shake hands with them, but I don&#x2019;t know if they will shake hands with us. We have been smiling at them [here in the parliament] but they don&#x2019;t smile back.&#x201d;&#xA;Aung San Suu Kyi will have to share power with the military, which retains three key ministries and a veto on constitutional changes. She is barred from taking the country&#x2019;s most powerful position herself but her party&#x2019;s overwhelming majority in both houses of parliament allows her to handpick the president.&#xA;Related: Poverty, ethnic tensions and China top agenda for Myanmar's new politicians&#xA;In the 2010 election which was widely dismissed as fraudulent and boycotted by the NLD, the Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP) &#x2013; the political group of the former military commander and current president Thein Sein &#x2013; came to power. Thein Sein was credited with releasing political prisoners, ending censorship, seeking peace with ethnic minority militants and paving the way towards credible elections.&#xA;Last week, he called on political parties to work together. &#x201c;Our government will help the new government,&#x201d; he said, praising the transition.&#xA;Than Soe, a USDP MP, said on Monday: &#x201c;There are no hard feelings. We accepted the people&#x2019;s choice.&#x201d;&#xA;Richard Horsey, an analyst based in Yangon and a former United Nations official, said the military&#x2019;s conciliatory attitude reflected an economic choice. &#x201c;Democracy has not been the driving force of this transition,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about liberalisation and opening up Myanmar to the global economy, and this is why it will continue.&#x201d; Foreign brands have flooded into the country since reforms started in 2011.&#xA;Despite the symbolic importance of Monday&#x2019;s session, the real political shift will happen at the end of March, when a new government will be formed and the new president will take over from Thein Sein. &#x201c;This is when the tricky bit starts,&#x201d; said Horsey.&#xA;&#x201c;The people have changed but the challenges are the same. And Aung San Suu Kyi will have, for example, to confront the situation [of the Muslim minority] in Rakhine as one of her priorities.&#x201d;&#xA;Aung San Suu Kyi has been criticised for not speaking out more strongly on the plight of the persecuted Burmese Muslims, many of whom were unable to vote . She has vowed that the first priority of the government will be national reconciliation &#x2013; not only with the military but also with half a dozen ethnic groups still fighting in the border areas.&#xA;A peace agreement was signed in October by eight out of 15 armed groups. However, clashes between non-signatory groups and the military have continued until recently.&#xA;Aung Win, 70, another NLD member, said he joined the military when he was 16. In 1988, during student protests, he left the army and spent two years in jail. He fought against ethnic insurgent militias, many of which are still battling the government for autonomy.&#xA;&#x201c;I saw the dead bodies on the ground, wearing poor clothes and uniforms. It was not their fault and I realised we were fighting against our own people,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I did not want to do that.&#x201d;&#xA;For Aung Win, the main challenge has already been won. &#x201c;I cannot describe what we feel about Aung San Suu Kyi,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Today would never have been possible without her.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

The heart of the city has never fully recovered from the brazen 1970s bulldozing of the magnificent, 19th-century wrought-iron market pavilions at Les Halles and the creation, in their place, of an airless underground transport and shopping complex seen as a monstrous, mirror-glassed carbuncle.&#xA;But after decades of cultural spats, protests and political handwringing, the city is finally attempting to make amends. Later this spring, Paris will unveil an entirely reworked Les Halles crowned with one of the most ambitious architectural projects of the decade &#x2013; a giant, undulating glass roof spanning 2.5 hectares, which hopes to literally put a lid on the problem.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Workers work on the building site of Les Halles. Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP&#xA;Known as &#x201c;the Canopy&#x201d; , the enormous, undulating roof is made up of 18,000 scale-like pieces of glass held in the air by 7,000 tonnes of steel at a cost of over &#x20ac;200m (£150m). It was designed to open up a new panorama across the city centre.&#xA;As the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo , toured the structure amid the rush to finish work on the &#x20ac;1bn refurbishment before the opening in April, she vowed that the area she once described as an &#x201c;urban catastrophe&#x201d; would now become &#x201c;the beating heart&#x201d; of the capital.&#xA;But a history of errors and regrets still hangs heavy over the site.&#xA;Related: Designers prepare Les Halles for a facelift&#xA;In the mid-19th century, architect Victor Baltard created what was hailed as a masterpiece of wrought-iron pavilions to house the city&#x2019;s wholesale market, described by Emile Zola as &#x201c;the belly of Paris&#x201d;. But the pavilions were bulldozed in the early 1970s. The giant gaping hole that was left there for years was so surreal that the Italian film director Marco Ferreri famously used it as the war-zone backdrop of his zany farce about the last stand of the American cavalry commander, Gen Custer.&#xA;The site was turned into a giant transport hub, with a massive intersection of suburban railway and metro lines that serves 750,000 passengers a day. It is Europe&#x2019;s biggest underground station, teamed with a giant subterranean shopping mall that has a footfall of 37 million people a year.&#xA;But until now, the complex was seen as so unappealing and difficult to find your way round that Parisians and tourists kept away if they could. Its reputation for petty drug-dealing made matters worse.&#xA;The refit aims to reconcile France with Les Halles by completely overhauling the station and mall, while adding a new stretch of gardens, a library, a new music and arts conservatory, and &#x2013; most importantly &#x2013; a unique centre for hip-hop.&#xA;"/>

Some of the victims have jointly filed a single complaint, so that the number of alleged crimes stands at more than 750, of which more than 380 are sexual offences, including at least three rapes.&#xA;Cologne police are investigating 43 suspects in connection with the incidents, the majority of whom are Moroccan or Algerian. Nine of the suspects are currently in prison.&#xA;Related: 'I&#x2019;ve never experienced anything like that': Cologne in deep shock over attacks&#xA;The organisers of the Cologne carnival have published a leaflet for refugees that explains the customs of the tradition, warning non-Germans not to worry if they meet locals wearing historic soldier uniforms. &#x201c;Their guns are only made of wood, and are only loaded with flowers &#x2013; every single one a small expression of colourful, peaceful coexistence,&#x201d; it reads.&#xA;Marking the last Thursday before Lent, Cologne&#x2019;s Weiberfastnacht traditionally sees women dressed in colourful costumes frequenting the streets and bars of the city, pecking strangers on the cheek and playing practical jokes, such as cutting off ties. The &#x201c;crazy days&#x201d; of carnival peak with a procession of floats on the following Monday.&#xA;Cologne&#x2019;s mayor, Henriette Reker, said she had &#x201c;not the slightest concern&#x201d; that people would not be able to celebrate carnival as usual, while also admitting that &#x201c;one can never provide a guarantee for 100% safety&#x201d;.&#xA;In an interview with Die Welt newspaper , Reker also said she regretted the phrasing of her controversial suggestion that women &#x201c;keep at arm&#x2019;s length&#x201d; from strangers to avoid harassment.&#xA;&#x201c;It would have been more sensible to say in that press conference that I was talking about New Year&#x2019;s Eve and nothing else,&#x201d; the mayor said. The remark about keeping strangers &#x201c;at arm&#x2019;s length&#x201d; had been a quote from a brochure for young women, Reker said.&#xA;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s something that every good mother would tell her daughter when she leaves the house. You can&#x2019;t do schunkeln [swaying from side to side with locked arms, another Cologne carnival custom] at arm&#x2019;s length either, I know that.

The influential Gault et Millau restaurant guide named him chef of the year.&#xA;Le Figaro declared him the &#x201c;world&#x2019;s best chef&#x201d;, a distinction he received with modesty.&#xA;Related: Benoît Violier&#x2019;s apparent suicide highlights pressures on top chefs&#xA;&#x201c;You can set up all the listings in the world &#x2026; what&#x2019;s important in the end is the customer,&#x201d; he said at the time. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the customer who comes back, who judges and who gives the truth.&#x201d;&#xA;Two months before the accolade, his 1,000-page cookery book on hunting, preparing and cooking wild fowl was published to critical acclaim, with one veteran chef describing it as the &#x201c;bible&#x201d; of its subject.&#xA;But Swiss police believe Violier shot himself with his hunting rifle at the weekend. His death has stunned those who knew him, with France&#x2019;s leading lights of gastronomy lining up to pay tribute.&#xA;Marc Veyrat, a celebrated three-star chef, said he was &#x201c;destroyed&#x201d; by news of Violier&#x2019;s death. &#x201c;The planet has been left orphaned by this exceptional chef,&#x201d; Veyrat wrote on Twitter .&#xA;In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Le Matin , Veyrat added: &#x201c;I met him several times and he seemed happy, strong. He had everything going for him. He&#x2019;d just done a magnificent book on hunting, he was doing so many things. Perhaps he couldn&#x2019;t ease up, but I can&#x2019;t say why, who knows why?&#x201d;&#xA;Veyrat added: &#x201c;Cooking is a high-pressured job. People don&#x2019;t realise how much. It&#x2019;s one of the few jobs where one is judged and marked all the time. What other profession would accept being constantly evaluated?&#x201d;&#xA;Pierre Gagnaire, another three-star Michelin chef, who was named by his peers as the &#x201c;biggest star chef in the world&#x201d; and who has restaurants in Paris, London, Tokyo, Dubai, Moscow and Berlin as well as Sketch in London, added: &#x201c;Terribly sad news for an extremely talented chef.&#x201d;&#xA;Paul Bocuse, named &#x201c;chef of the century&#x201d; by the food guide Gault et Millau and the Culinary Institute of America, said of Violier: &#x201c;A grand chef, a grand man, a gigantic talent.&#x201d;&#xA;Frédy Girardet, a friend of Violier and his wife Brigitte, and another three-star titan of Swiss haute cuisine who had previously run the restaurant in Crissier, said he was &#x201c;completely stunned&#x201d;.&#xA;He told the Tribune de Genève: &#x201c;I can see no motive for such an act. He was a brilliant young man, with enormous talent and an impressive work potential. He gave the impression of being perfect. This news is so sad.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

Photograph: Reuters&#xA;Freeman is more optimistic. Havana will be saved from the worst effects of commercial speculation, he thinks, by a combination of glacial Cuban bureaucracy and happy accident. &#x201c;Nothing is going to happen very quickly, for the simple reason that it takes so long to get anything done,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Other countries have been trying to develop in Cuba for decades, and they&#x2019;ve been stymied all along by the country&#x2019;s sclerotic controls over every aspect of economic activity.&#x201d; The harbour will also be protected from the &#x201c;Venice syndrome&#x201d; of vast cruise-ships dwarfing the city with their stacked cliff-faces of cabins, he says, because the boats simply won&#x2019;t be able to get in. A road tunnel, laid across the bottom of the bay in a big concrete tube in the 1950s, makes it too shallow for them to enter.&#xA;At the other end of the scale from the grand waterfront plans, there are signs across the city of a new kind of real-estate development. Scaffolding has long shrouded much of Havana, but it no longer just signals the work of the City Historian. Recent changes to property laws, which have allowed Cubans to buy and sell their own homes for the first time in years, paired with a relaxation of US rules on how much money Cuban-Americans can send to their family back home, have spawned a micro-real estate industry of independent renovation. Families with access to cash from overseas are doing up crumbling buildings themselves and either letting them out as holiday rentals (possible through Airbnb since last year) or selling them on &#x2013; minting a wealthy new class in the process.&#xA;Related: Havana: one of the world's great cities on the brink of a fraught transition&#xA;It is a change in legislation that foreign companies have been quick to pounce on. Choy is currently putting the finishing touches to the renovation of a building on the waterfront, working closely with Cuba Real Tours &#x2013; one of a growing number of companies developing boutique holiday lets across the city. Such outfits aren&#x2019;t allowed to own the properties directly, making their investments in refurbishment a risky business.&#xA;They have also encountered the chief difficulty of anyone trying to do construction work in Cuba: the dearth of materials. Glass still isn&#x2019;t produced on the island, so each window has to be imported &#x2013; and the customs limit of four windows per person, or two doors, mean these small-scale refurbishments often entail getting friends and family to help out.&#xA;But such obstacles certainly haven&#x2019;t limited the aspirations of would-be developers, or the level of quality that they can achieve with a bit of Cuban resourcefulness. Freeman describes an &#x201c;eye-popping&#x201d; day he spent with one of Havana&#x2019;s fledgling estate agents, touring spectacular 1950s houses that had been fixed up extraordinarily lavishly and are now being offered for up to $800,000.&#xA;Elsewhere there are penthouses listed for more than $2m, although no one knows how much anything is really worth: there are no benchmarks and no mortgage industry. Instead, people gather at the end of Paseo del Prado, standing with handwritten signs around their necks, displaying faded photos of apartments for sale, and browsing listings written in dog-eared exercise books. It is one of the many strange scenes in Havana of micro-capitalism at work &#x2013; which clearly won&#x2019;t be micro for much longer.&#xA;Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion&#xA;"/>

Police also said they found &#x201c;interesting documentation&#x201d; after home searches, and that the investigation into the counterfeit bottles was continuing, zeroing in on the source of the sparkling wine and other materials.&#xA;The wine itself is not going to waste. Police said that, in accordance with other legal authorities, the bottles had been donated to &#x201c;associations&#x201d; working in the Veneto, the home of prosecco, Italy&#x2019;s answer to French champagne.&#xA;"/>

It says they have criticised David Cameron&#x2019;s EU renegotiation deal even though it has delivered many of the things that in the past they have supported.&#xA;This is from Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative MP and Stronger In (to use the shorthand that the group itself uses) campaigner.&#xA;In the past, Leave campaigners have called for wide-ranging reforms to Britain&#x2019;s place in Europe. Yet today they have lambasted the reforms put forward by Donald Tusk before the negotiation is even complete. This is idiotic hypocrisy. These reform proposals are the very areas for change that Leave campaigners have long called for. They have rejected a deal before it has even been secured.&#xA;Today it&#x2019;s clear that there is a deep hypocrisy at the heart of the Leave campaigners&#x2019; criticisms: they are the only people who have given up on reform and want to walk away from Europe come what may.&#x201d;&#xA;It&#x2019;s clear now that the Leave campaigns have pre-emptively rejected the final renegotiation package because they want to walk away from Europe come what may. The leave campaigns&#x2019; hypocrisy will put the many benefits we gain from being in Europe &#x2013; trade, jobs, low prices, investment &#x2013; at risk.&#xA;There is a 12-page document setting out example of what Soames is referring to here (pdf).&#xA;&#x2014; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) February 2, 2016&#xA;voxpop survey in Chippenham town: 2in, 1out. 1/4 knew what red cards/emerg brakes were, 3/4 said PM would sway vote pic.twitter.com/WbYVpvOLlT&#xA;Lord Ashcroft explored this issue in a very detailed report on public opinion on the EU issue published in December last year, Leave to Remain (pdf). It combines polling with focus group research, and is well worth reading if you are following this issue closely.&#xA;Here is the key chart.

Most of them say Cameron claiming he has got a good deal will make no difference to how they vote, while 30% say it will make them more likely to vote Out. (That is hard to believe; people in this group are fairly determined to vote Out anyway.)&#xA;But almost half the people in &#x201c;Global Britain&#x201d;, the second group strongly inclined to vote out, accounting for 13% of the population, say a Cameron recommendation could make them more likely to vote to remain.&#xA;Ashcroft has divided those broadly undecided into two groups: &#x201c;Hard-pressed undecided&#x201d; (19% of the population) and &#x201c;Listen to DC&#x201d; (13%). A clear majority of &#x201c;Listen to DC&#x201d;, unsurprisingly, say would be more likely to vote In on the basis of a recommendation from Cameron, and a quarter of the &#x201c;Hard-pressed undecideds&#x201d; say the same.&#xA;The other three groups, &#x201c;If it ain&#x2019;t broke&#x201d; (12%), &#x201c;I&#x2019;m alright Jacques&#x201d; (11%) and &#x201c;Citizens of the world&#x201d; (9%), are all inclined to vote In. Amongst the first two, a Cameron recommendation would make a big difference. Cameron would have less impact on &#x201c;Citizens of the world&#x201d; but that may be because they are strongly inclined to vote In anyway.&#xA;"/>

Firing straight at unarmed people is unacceptable.&#x201d;&#xA;The police and the Rangers, a paramilitary organisation with a lead role in securing the city, denied that any of their officers opened fire and announced an investigation.&#xA;Selling off the struggling national carrier was one of the election pledges of the ruling faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and is a condition of a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.&#xA;On Monday, legislation was passed to stop airline workers from striking for six months, although the PIA union vowed to fight on.&#xA;In the wake of the killings, the Pakistan Airline Pilots&#x2019; Association said its members would join the strike.&#xA;The government hopes to find a buyer for a strategic stake, but the airline requires a radical overhaul. The carrier has become notorious for waste, poor service and chronic overstaffing caused by decades of political appointees.&#xA;Considered one of the world&#x2019;s best airlines in the 1970s, PIA&#x2019;s ageing fleet and chronic management troubles have turned it into a major burden on Pakistan&#x2019;s finances.&#xA;The airline has faced a number of embarrassing scandals, including pilots found to have been flying over the alcohol limit or without proper qualifications.&#xA;"/>

Broadway has come to the boulevards .&#xA;Related: Broadway mélodies: Kiss Me Kate at the Châtelet in Paris &#x2013; in pictures&#xA;Kiss Me Kate has several hard acts to follow. It opens a fortnight after the Châtelet&#x2019;s sell-out run of Singin&#x2019; in the Rain, which followed My Fair Lady, Sweeney Todd and An American in Paris , to give a non-exhaustive list. Parisians who loved the operetta but regarded the Anglo-Saxon comédie musicale as a lower art form now snap up seats for Châtelet shows so quickly they often sell out before opening. The Châtelet has purloined the American musical classics and made them its own, but à la Française: Kiss Me Kate is showmanship and spectacle at its grandest and most extravagant. The musicals are staged in English but with French surtitles, and the intricacies of the rhymes can be a nightmare for translators.&#xA;There is the orchestra for starters. When musical director David Charles Abell taps his baton, around 40 musicians take note. Kiss Me Kate, featuring Shakespeare&#x2019;s Taming of the Shrew as a show within the show, has up to 36 performers on the stage, three massive scenery trucks, complex choreography and a stunning range of costumes reflecting two periods: Tudor England and America of the 40s and 50s.&#xA;Related: Singin&#x2019; in the Rain review &#x2013; a big splash on the Paris stage&#xA;Lee Blakeley, a Yorkshireman who has directed several of its musicals, says the theatre &#x2013; and particularly its director, Jean-Luc Choplin &#x2013; encourages him to &#x201c;dream big&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;The last Broadway revival of Kiss Me Kate had roughly 19 people on stage with people doubling up roles.

And today I can give a very clear answer: if I could get these terms for British membership, I sure would opt in to be a member of the EU because they are good terms and they are different to what other countries have.&#x201d;&#xA;Tusk&#x2019;s papers proposed that Britain would be able to request an &#x201c;emergency brake&#x201d; on in-work benefits for EU migrants for up to four years, subject to permission from other member states.&#xA;The prime minister, speaking at the Wiltshire branch of Siemens, stressed that the deal was not yet finalised and would have to be approved by EU leaders at their next summit on 18-19 February. But he said he would campaign for a yes vote in the referendum, which he hoped would be held before the 2017 deadline.&#xA;Cameron indicated that he would prefer to hold the referendum reasonably soon. Downing Street hopes that if a deal is reached at the next European council, or at a special summit in late February or early March, then the referendum could be held on 23 June.&#xA;The prime minister said: &#x201c;I can say, hand on heart, I have delivered the commitments that I made in my manifesto. If, for instance, you pay people £5,000 to £10,000 additional to their wages then that is a draw to Britain ... This is a negotiation, this has to be agreed by 27 other countries. This is something no government or country has managed before: to start a renegotiation from a standing start, bring it to a conclusion and hold a referendum.&#x201d;&#xA;David Cameron hails terms of draft EU reforms&#xA;Jeremy Corbyn criticised Cameron for giving a speech in Chippenham and allowing briefings to the media rather than going to the House of Commons to answer questions.&#xA;The Labour leader said the prime minister was showing a lack of respect for MPs and appeared more concerned with internal Tory splits on the EU than explaining the deal to parliament.&#xA;&#x201c;He is trumpeting the sovereignty of national parliaments as part of the renegotiations, but doesn&#x2019;t seem to respect the sovereignty of this parliament by coming here today to make the statement he should have done,&#x201d; Corbyn said.&#xA;Cameron will give a statement to MPs on Wednesday after prime minister&#x2019;s questions. His absence from the Commons for Corbyn&#x2019;s urgent question meant he was not there to hear Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers pour scorn on his deal.&#xA;Steve Baker, the leader of the Conservative leave campaign, told parliament that ministers were &#x201c;polishing poo&#x201d; by trying to present the EU offer as a victory, while his colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg said Downing Street appeared to be trying to &#x201c;make bricks out of straw&#x201d;. Sir Bill Cash, a veteran anti-EU campaigner, questioned how the government could justify such a &#x201c;pint-sized package&#x201d; from the EU as fundamental change.&#xA;Related: Cameron&#x2019;s EU deal: the verdict from our panel | Matthew d&#x2019;Ancona, Daniel Hannan, Tom Clark and Natalie Nougayrède&#xA;Liam Fox, the former defence secretary who is one of the most senior Tories campaigning for a vote to leave the EU, dismissed the Tusk offer. &#x201c;The very limited set of demands from our government have been watered down by the EU in every area,&#x201d; Fox said. &#x201c;None of these changes even come close to the fundamental changes promised to the public.&#x201d;&#xA;Cameron said he had secured concessions in the four main areas on welfare &#x2013; no unemployment benefit for EU citizens; no ability to remain in the UK if an EU citizen fails to secure a job after six months; child benefit paid at the rate of an EU citizen&#x2019;s home country if their child remains there; no instant access to the UK&#x2019;s welfare system, with a four-year wait.&#xA;The prime minister said that if he secures the changes he will throw himself into the referendum campaign to keep Britain in the EU. He said: &#x201c;If we can get that deal, for reasons of prosperity and security, we are better off in a reformed EU. There will be no lack of passion on my part.&#xA;&#x201c;If that is what I can secure on 18 February &#x2013; or later if it takes longer, and I will take as long as I need to get this deal &#x2013; you will see me going round the country arguing for the future of our country, and I would argue for the future of Europe with all the benefits Britain brings to the EU that we should stay in that reformed EU.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

In a briefing on the verdict, Fayadh&#x2019;s lawyer said the new judgement revoked the death sentence but upheld that the poet was guilty of apostasy.&#xA;A memo written by the lawyer, posted by Abdulrahman al-Lahem on Twitter , describes the details of Fayadh&#x2019;s new punishment. He is sentenced to eight years in prison and 800 lashes, with 50 lashes carried out on 16 occasions, and must also publicly renounce his poetry on Saudi state media.&#xA;Al-Lahem welcomed the overturning of the death sentence but reaffirmed Fayadh&#x2019;s innocence and announced they would launch an appeal and ask for bail.&#xA;Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: &#x201c;Instead of beheading Ashraf Fayadh, a Saudi court has ordered a lengthy imprisonment and flogging. No one should face arrest for peacefully expressing opinions, much less corporal punishment and prison. Saudi justice officials must urgently intervene to vacate this unjust sentence.&#x201d;&#xA;Author Irvine Welsh said: &#x201c;When this twisted barbarism is thought of a compromise, it&#x2019;s way past time western governments stopped dealing with this pervert regime.&#x201d;&#xA;The death sentence imposed in November on the poet provoked worldwide outcry.&#xA;Hundreds of leading authors, artists and actors, including the director of Tate Modern Chris Dercon, British poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, author Irvine Welsh and actor Helen Mirren, have appealed for his release . More than 60 international arts and human rights groups, including Amnesty International and writers&#x2019; association PEN International, have launched a campaign calling on the Saudi authorities and western governments to save him. Readings of his poetry in support of his case took place in 44 countries last week .&#xA;Jo Glanville, director of writers&#x2019; association English PEN, which appealed for Fayadh&#x2019;s release, said: &#x201c;It is a relief that Ashraf Fayadh no longer faces execution, but this is a wholly disproportionate and shocking sentence. It will cause dismay around the world for all Ashraf&#x2019;s many supporters. The charges against him should have been dropped and he should be a free man today. We will continue to campaign for his release.&#x201d;&#xA;Fayadh has spent almost two years in prison in Abha, a city in the south-west of the ultraconservative kingdom. He is suffering from mental health problems.&#xA;The 35-year-old Palestinian refugee rose to prominence as an artist and curator for the British-Saudi art group, Edge of Arabia. He went on to curate shows in Jeddah and at the 2013 Venice Biennale which showcased an emerging generation of Saudi artists.&#xA;But in August 2013 he was detained by the mutaween (religious police) following a complaint that he was cursing against Allah and the prophet Muhammad, insulting Saudi Arabia and distributing a book of his poems that promoted atheism. Fayadh said the complaint arose from a personal dispute during a discussion in a cafe in Abha.&#xA;Although he was released after one day he was arrested again on 1 January 2014 and detained at a police station before being transferred to the local prison 27 days later. At his trial in May 2014, he was sentenced to four years in prison and 800 lashes by the general court in Abha.&#xA;He was also found guilty of storing images of women on his phone, which friends and colleagues said were artists appearing in his show at the Jeddah art fair.&#xA;After his appeal was dismissed he was retried on 17 November 2015 and sentenced to death by a new panel of judges, who ruled that his repentance did not prevent his execution.&#xA;But appeal documents submitted by his lawyer last month argued that Fayadh&#x2019;s conviction was based on uncorroborated allegations and ignored evidence that he suffered from a mental illness.&#xA;Fayadh&#x2019;s father suffered a stroke after hearing his son was to be beheaded. Fayadh was unable to visit him before he died last month, nor was he allowed to attend his funeral.&#xA;In documents considered by the panel of judges, Abdulrahman al-Lahem, a human rights lawyer, argues that Fayadh&#x2019;s initial arrest in 2013 was unlawful as it was not ordered by the state prosecution service. The allegation of apostasy made by Shaheen bin Ali Abu Mismar, who is alleged to have had a personal dispute with the poet, was not corroborated by other evidence, which goes against the principles of sharia law, it argues.&#xA;The appeal document also states that the November ruling ignored testimony by defence witnesses in Fayadh&#x2019;s 2014 trial who said Abu Mismar was lying, and from the accuser&#x2019;s uncle who also indicated that he was not truthful, according to the appeal. It contends that the &#x201c;judiciary cannot rely on [his evidence] due to the possibility that it is malicious&#x201d;.&#xA;Additional reporting by Mona Mahmood&#xA;"/>

So he quit his job and travelled to Khartoumfor a 10-day research visit, in January.&#xA;He collected family recipes, cooked with his two aunts, and visited restaurants, markets and museums.&#xA;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about placing the food in its context,&#x201d; Eltigani explained. The book will include around 40 recipes and is aimed at foreigners but also Sudanese chefs looking to learn more about their country&#x2019;s cooking.&#xA;Politics at the table&#xA;But his insistence on tying the cuisine to Sudan&#x2019;s turbulent history has made difficulties in finding publishers in Britain, who would prefer just a book of plain recipes, he said, but &#x201c;you can&#x2019;t really not talk about politics and talk about Sudan&#x201d;.&#xA;Under Arab and African influences, Sudan was colonised in the 19th century by the Ottomans, and then by Britain and Egypt until 1956.&#xA;Its post-independence history has been blighted by civil war, military dictatorship, unrest and poverty and each period has affected the way Sudanese people eat, Eltigani said. A fact he wants to be central to the book.&#xA;"/>

While most domestic industries are uncompetitive by global standards, they are strong enough to create both risks and opportunities for all players.&#xA;Iranians are hungry for foreign brands, but 95% of Iran&#x2019;s food market and 80% of its pharmaceutical market have been &#x201c;captured&#x201d; by Iranian companies, according to a poll mapping the frequency with which Iranians mentioned the brands they use in daily life.&#xA;Iranian brands also dominate sales of hair products, clothing, and vehicles, according to the poll, which was conducted in October 2015 by Toronto-based IranPoll.com in partnership with Tehran Bureau.&#xA;The strength of domestic brands results in part from the way Iran has been forced to fend for itself by the stiffening of international sanctions. Governments have made economic self-sufficiency a priority, following policies of import substitution and imposing high tariffs on most imported goods to nurture domestic industries.&#xA;Iran&#x2019;s food industry is crowded with domestic manufacturers like snack-food producer Maz Maz, ketchup maker Delpazir and dairy producer Kalleh. &#x201c;One of the biggest advantages of Iranian food brands thus far has been their much lower price relative to foreign brands,&#x201d; said Ebrahim Mohseni, a research associate at the University of Maryland, who studies public opinion in the Middle East. &#x201c;In many countries neighbouring Iran, international brands like Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Kraft and Heinz face little or no competition. This is not the case in Iran.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: China floods Iran with cheap consumer goods in exchange for oil&#xA;The strong presence of domestic competitors makes Iran unique in the Middle East and North Africa , said Mohseni: &#x201c;What has happened in other countries is that they have simply not even tried to compete with western brands. In Iran, for almost every foreign brand, there is an Iranian substitute.&#x201d;&#xA;Among food producers, Kalleh has grown into an empire since it was formed in the 1980s. Market research firm Euromonitor International ranks it among the world&#x2019;s top 50 brands, just two places behind Nutella and two above noodles-producer Maruchan.&#xA;With factories across Iran, Kalleh exports 600 tonnes (590 UK tons) of dairy products per day to Iran&#x2019;s neighbours, producing $205m revenue in the Iranian year 2014-15. They also have factories in Iraq, including Karbala and Najaf.&#xA;The company&#x2019;s CEO and founder Gholam-Ali Soleimani is targeting $300m for the current Iranian year, ending in March. Kalleh may not have been able to purchase new specialist cheese equipment because of sanctions, but the company has imported second-hand machinery and is producing cheddar, parmesan, and gouda as Iran&#x2019;s middle class develops more adventurous tastes.&#xA;Aside from the food sector and a handful of traditional Iranian exports, however, most Iranian brands have struggled to reach international standards, with industries lacking modern equipment. Protectionist policies have lowered their ability to compete in an open market because they sheltered them from the international competition that could have driven them to improve and innovate.&#xA;Related: Iran's revolutionary ideology clashes with thirst for new investments&#xA;&#x201c;The reality about Iranian brands is that they are not [of good] quality, though they&#x2019;re stronger when it comes to foodstuffs, carpets and handicrafts,&#x201d; said Ali Heydarhai, an office manager in Tehran. &#x201c;Unfortunately, in terms of production, we don&#x2019;t have any high-quality and exquisite goods that can grab the attention of [domestic] consumers.&#x201d;&#xA;Some multinationals have managed to retain a presence in Iran despite sanctions. According to the frequency respondents mentioned specific brands, the poll found Samsung, LG and Sony dominate the audio and video systems market (93% ), mobile phones (97%) and small home appliances (63%).&#xA;But the poll found that 58% of Iranians thought importing more foreign-made goods would benefit the economy. Respondents expressed a preference for German, Japanese, French and American goods, and viewed those from China as substandard. At the height of the sanctions in 2013, China exported $13.7bn to Iran, becoming the country&#x2019;s single largest source of imports.&#xA;This would explain why traces of Iran&#x2019;s pre-revolutionary consumer tastes remain so evident in everyday speech in which diapers are called &#x2018;Pampers&#x2019;, razors are &#x2018;Gillettes&#x2019;, washing powder is &#x2018;Tide&#x2019; and tissues are sometimes called &#x2019;Kleenex&#x2019;.&#xA;&#x201c;People are tired of a non-competitive market,&#x201d; said Amir Farmanesh, IranPoll.com co-founder. He pointed to Iran&#x2019;s vehicle industry, known among Iranians for pollutant-spewing petrol guzzlers like the domestically made Kia Pride. &#x201c;What they&#x2019;re thinking is that more competition will push Iranian products to increase their quality.&#x201d;&#xA;An influx of foreign firms would bring serious challenges for all involved, added Mohseni. Even if new brands had to struggle against red tape and a lack of market knowledge, they would bankrupt a number of Iranian companies and so hike an already high unemployment rate.&#xA;All of which leaves the government with the task of promoting growth while tempering the impact of shock therapy. President Hassan Rouhani also faces pressure from vested interests &#x2013; including well-connected quasi-state groups &#x2013; who control key Iranian industries.&#xA;&#x201c;These powerful entities will certainly attack Rouhani for not only exporting Iranian jobs to Europe, but also threatening Iran&#x2019;s cultural and religious values by importing western goods,&#x201d; said Mohseni.&#xA;To alleviate the pressure and save the labour market, Rouhani could take a protectionist stance and re-impose higher tariffs on imports. But this would negate the nuclear deal&#x2019;s most immediate benefits in the eyes of ordinary Iranians, many of whom, the poll shows, want easier access to western-made goods.&#xA;This presents the president with some tricky decisions, said Mohseni: &#x201c;Rouhani will have a tough time balancing between the demand of Iranian consumers for higher-quality, more cost-effective commodities and creating jobs.&#x201d;&#xA;The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

Photograph: breathoflifestar&#xA;The ambitious centrepiece echoes the panoramic paintings at the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War museum in Pyongyang &#x2013; minus the North Korean propaganda.&#xA;Walking the circular viewing deck, visitors start with horrific scenes from the Cham War between the Khmers and the Vietnamese before moving on to the construction of the famous Bayon Temple and ending with the daily life of Khmers.&#xA;Surrounding the viewing deck is an artificial jungle constructed from fake trees, rocks, huts and sculptures which seamlessly meets the painted wall.&#xA;Originally from Pyongyang, the tour guide explains that a &#x201c;merited artist&#x201d; from Mansudae, North Korea&#x2019;s biggest art studio in Pyongyang, was responsible for the main piece, but that it took 63 artists almost two years to complete.&#xA;But the state-run studio, which employs 4,000 people, is no stranger to creating gigantic works of art: its artists have built almost every statue, sculpture and piece of propagandist art currently on show North Korea.&#xA;The mansudae made statues of late North Korean leaders Kim Il-sung, and Kim Jong-il.&#xA;Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP&#xA;Lucrative asset&#xA;Its international division, the Mansudae Overseas Projects Group, is a thriving multi-million dollar business bringing in much needed funds to the isolated regime.&#xA;A host of foreign governments have requested their own grandiose, often propaganda-themed projects. Mansudae commissions include Botswana&#x2019;s Three Dikgosi Monument ; Senegal&#x2019;s African Renaissance monument ; Namibia&#x2019;s Heroes&#x2019; Acre ; Benin&#x2019;s King Behazin&#x2019;s Statue and the Democratic Republic of Congo&#x2019;s statue of former dictator, Laurent Kabila .&#xA;Other projects have included Angola&#x2019;s Agostino Neto Mausoleum , which is reported to have cost $55m, and two statues of Robert Mugabe thought to have cost Zimbabwe $5m. The group also contributed panoramic murals to Syria&#x2019;s October War Museum.&#xA;Special relationship&#xA;Ever since the 1940s, when Kim Il-sung and Cambodia&#x2019;s Norodom Sihanouk first became friends, the two countries have historically enjoyed a special relationship.&#xA;Related: North Korean restaurants springing up around Asia to raise money for regime&#xA;But though in recent times this seems to have waned &#x2013; with Hun Sen&#x2019;s current government favouring investment from South Korea &#x2013; Cambodia hasn&#x2019;t cut ties with the DPRK completely.&#xA;Last year the country was reported to have banned The Interview, an American comedy about Kim Jong-un, after pressure from the North, and though the Angkor Panorama Museum is the first cultural project of its kind, North Koreans have run &#x201c;Pyongyang&#x201d; themed restaurants in Siem Reap and the capital Phnom Penh for years.&#xA;&#x201c;I believe that Angkor Panorama Museum, one of the symbols of friendship and cooperation between the DPRK and the Kingdom of Cambodia, will contribute to further consolidate our traditional friendship,&#x201d; said Hong Ki-chol, the North Korean ambassador to Cambodia .&#xA;The official statement from Cambodia&#x2019;s deputy prime minister Sok An added that the museum would be a valuable contribution to their tourist industry and help strengthen &#x201c;friendship and cooperation between the two nations.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.&#xA;Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.&#xA;Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran&#x2019;s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents.&#xA;&#x201c;The stakes are much higher now,&#x201d; says Hakimzadeh. &#x201c;In my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Iran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani&#xA;One example is the charge of moharebeh, or &#x2018;waging war against God&#x2019;, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from &#x2018;armed war against the state&#x2019; and &#x2018;heresy&#x2019; to include &#x2018;working to undermine the Islamic establishment&#x2019; and &#x2018;cooperating with foreign agents or entities&#x2019;. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally.&#xA;Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.&#xA;Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.&#xA;Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery.&#xA;&#x201c;We realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,&#x201d; she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. &#x201c;These issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.&#x201d;&#xA;These basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the &#x2018;Safe Activism&#x2019; booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.&#xA;Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges.&#xA;The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder.&#xA;Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.&#x201d;&#xA;Keeping insanity at bay&#xA;Activists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to &#x2018;gather information and get to know the person better.&#x2019;&#xA;&#x201c;For others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,&#x201d; says Hakimzadeh.&#xA;The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject&#x2019;s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness.&#xA;Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when &#x2018;confessing&#x2019;. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator&#x2019;s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.&#xA;Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death.&#xA;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.&#x201d;&#xA;As time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay.&#xA;&#x201c;I had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Having writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.&#x201d;&#xA;The Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women&#x2019;s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups.&#xA;&#x201c;Some of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran&#x2019;s Evin Prison], but I didn&#x2019;t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,&#x201d; says Hakimzadeh.&#xA;While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.&#xA;Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a &#x201c;smarter approach&#x201d;, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a &#x201c;person knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;At the very least,&#x201d; adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, &#x201c;it lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.&#x201d;&#xA;The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

The jihadis enforced sharia law in places that had been Muslim for centuries, banning radio stations, TV sets, bars and nightclubs, effectively putting life on hold.&#xA;&#x201c;It was truly devastating&#x201d;, said musician Toumani Diabaté. &#x201c;I grew up with the Qur&#x2019;an and the kora [a west African instrument]. To even imagine that I would be in trouble for playing a traditional Malian instrument, a part of our culture, I would have never imagined this in Mali.&#x201d;&#xA;The occupation forced the cancellation of the country&#x2019;s many world-famous festivals, with events such as the acclaimed Festival in the Desert near Timbuktu suspended indefinitely.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Songhoy Blues back home in Mali.

During the crisis even those were scarce.&#x201d;&#xA;Three years later, low-level violence continues in the north and beyond, with an Islamist attack on a hotel in the capital in November and a similar terrorist assault in Burkina Faso in January. But there are signs that things are changing.&#xA;Last year Bamako witnessed the return of Les Rencontres , a photographic festival cancelled during the war. These days bands perform in bars in the capital most nights of the week and regular street parties have whole neighbourhoods dancing.&#xA;The annual Festival on the Niger is expected to be held this year, though major concerts at the main stage on the banks of the Niger have been cancelled.&#xA;In Gao, the largest city in the north, bars and nightclubs have reopened. Musicians and griots, Mali&#x2019;s esteemed storytellers, perform at weddings and the occasional neighbourhood rap concert, although artists point out that life has not yet returned to normal.&#xA;&#x201c;When most of your friends and youth in town are employed by the army or Minusma, the UN peacekeeping mission, something is not right,&#x201d; says Aliou Touré. &#x201c;Going a few kilometres into the desert where we used play music on the dunes you risk running into the rebels or even the jihadis.&#x201d;&#xA;But the line-up for the Bamako festival suggests the country is regaining its place on the cultural scene. The list of performers reads like a hall of fame of the country&#x2019;s international stars, including Oumou Sangaré, Nahawa Doumbia, Cheick Tidiane Seck and Sidiki Diabaté. Diabaté has also called in favours from friends abroad, among them the British singer and composer Damon Albarn and the Paris-based duo Amadou &amp; Mariam.&#xA;&#x201c;They are here because they know they have an important role to play,&#x201d; Diabaté said. &#x201c;In Mali it&#x2019;s really the artists that can speak to the people about reconciliation and peace.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

However, given the myriad domestic concerns facing the country &#x2013; including calls for Jacob Zuma to step down &#x2013; South Africa&#x2019;s president seems unlikely to get involved at this time.&#xA;So perhaps Tanzania is the next best candidate. The energetic commitment of its new president, John Magufuli, to reforming the country has made him popular in the region, and taking the lead on Burundi would be the perfect opportunity for him to gain standing on the international scene too. Given the presence of 140,000 Burundian refugees on Tanzania&#x2019;s soil, Magufuli already has the legitimacy he needs to lead diplomatic efforts.&#xA;Targeted sanctions&#xA;"/>

In total the refugee has so far had one request for temporary asylum and two requests for permanent asylum rejected.&#xA;Of 211 North Koreans who appealed to the Russian migration service between 2004 and 2014, only two received asylum, while 90 received temporary asylum for one year, according to Gannushkina&#x2019;s Citizen Assistance group.&#xA;North Korea and Russia signed an agreement in November to deport each other&#x2019;s undocumented citizens.

But bigger things &#x2013; way beyond Greece&#x2019;s control &#x2013; have put an end to that. Across Europe walls have come down; barriers have gone up and rhetoric has swelled as EU member states, one after another in the wave of the jihadi attacks on Paris, have reinforced frontiers and closed their doors.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Migrants play soccer at the Eleonas refugee camp in Athens. Eleonas is filling up as thousands are prevented from continuing their journey north. Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters&#xA;Suddenly, Eleonas&#x2019;s cabins are filling up, its residents, like Walter, prevented from continuing their journey north by nations no longer willing to accept anyone not deemed to be from a war-torn zone. And it may just be the beginning.&#xA;With Brussels contemplating drastic measures to stem the flow, calls are mounting to seal the Greek-Macedonian border, raising fears of hundreds of thousands being stranded in Greece, the country now perceived to be the continent&#x2019;s weakest link.&#xA;Related: Greek islanders to be nominated for Nobel peace prize&#xA;The prospect of migrants being trapped in a member state that financially is also Europe&#x2019;s most fragile may once have seemed extreme, even absurd. Its economy ravaged by six years of internationally mandated austerity and record levels of unemployment, Greece&#x2019;s coping strategies are markedly strained. But as EU policymakers seek ever more desperate ways to deal with what has become the largest mass movement of people since the second world war, it is an action plan being actively worked on by mandarins at the highest level. Like so much else in the great existential crisis facing Europe, a proposed policy that was once seen as bizarre now looks like it could become real.&#xA;Last week Athens was also given a three-month ultimatum to improve the way it processes arrivals and polices its borders &#x2013; at nearly 8,700 miles the longest in Europe &#x2013; or face suspension from the passport-free Schengen zone. Closure of the Greek-Macedonian frontier would effectively cut it out of that fraternity.&#xA;Those who have watched Greece&#x2019;s rollercoaster struggle to keep insolvency at bay are united in their conviction that the move would be catastrophic. &#x201c;It would place a timebomb under the foundations of Greece,&#x201d; says Aliki Mouriki, a prominent sociologist at the National Centre of Social Research. &#x201c;Hundreds of thousands of refugees trapped in a country that is bankrupt, that has serious administrative and organisational weaknesses, with a state that is unable to provide for their basic needs?&#x201d; The question hangs in the air while she searches for the right word. &#x201c;What we would witness,&#x201d; she adds, &#x201c;would be the definition of dystopia.&#x201d;&#xA;Like the mayors who have been forced to deal with the emergency on Greece&#x2019;s eastern Aegean isles, federal politicians believe Turkey is the root of the problem. &#x201c;With all due respect for a country that is hosting 2 million refugees, it is Turkey that must do something to stop the organised crime, the smugglers working along its coast,&#x201d; Yannis Mouzalas, the minister for migration policy, told the Observer. &#x201c;These flows are not Greece&#x2019;s fault even if, it is true, we have been slow to set up hotspots and screening was not always what it should have been,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is Turkey that turns a blind eye to them coming here. It is Turkey that must stop them. Why is Greece guilty? Because it doesn&#x2019;t let them drown?&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Greece hits back after EU's Schengen threat&#xA;Two months after the European Union decided to shower gifts on Ankara &#x2013; taking the unprecedented step of paying it &#x20ac;3bn to staunch the exodus &#x2013; Athens is still praying the deal will work. If Turkey can institute policies that will give incentives to Syrians to enter its labour market, crack down on the traffickers working along its western shores and successfully apply a readmission agreement, such measures could also be used in Jordan and Lebanon.&#xA;But optimism is in short supply. Turkey is pressing for more money amid grumbling that the initial payment has yet to be received as member states, led by Italy, bicker over the wisdom of having signed such an accord at all.&#xA;The timetable is pressing. In March, German chancellor Angela Merkel faces crucial regional elections, by which time she wants to have seen a tangible reduction in immigrant numbers. The European commission has also said a solution is not months but weeks away if the borderless Schengen area &#x2013; the continent&#x2019;s greatest achievement &#x2013; is to survive.&#xA;"/>

Four have been charged, but there are still uncertainties as to the reasons for his killing, or the cause of the helicopter crash.&#xA;The country is plagued by corruption, an acknowledgement made by recently elected president John Magufuli, who won the election on an anti-corruption ticket.&#xA;Tanzania is the largest source of poached ivory in the world and China the largest market for smuggled tusks. According to one report , there is direct collusion between Chinese criminal gangs and Tanzanian officials in the trade of ivory. The vast majority of the illegal ivory &#x2013; experts say as much as 70% &#x2013; is sent to China.&#xA;Though the Chinese have coveted ivory for centuries, never before have so many been able to afford it, whatever the price. Its economic boom has created a vast middle class, increasing the demand for ivory and pushing the price to stratospheric levels. Within the next 15 years, another 250 million people are expected to join China&#x2019;s middle class, something that will squeeze countries like Tanzania further still.&#xA;I spent much of last year in and around Tanzania&#x2019;s Serengeti national park for a new TV series following the migration of the wildebeest. I saw firsthand the devastating consequences of poaching. I saw elephants with ivory hacked from their faces and the lengths private parks go to protect their precious wildlife.&#xA;Last June, I attended a government wildlife seminar in Arusha that was hosted by one of the country&#x2019;s largest game hunting safari companies. The helicopters and champagne seemed at odds with the astonishing and embarrassing announcement from the country&#x2019;s minister for natural resources and tourism, Lazaro Nyalandu, that between 2009 and 2014 the number of elephants dropped from 109,051 to 43,330 - a 60% decline .&#xA;Ivory is quickly becoming the new blood diamond of Africa and one that fuels militia battles. Some of the most notorious armed groups on the continent, including the Lord&#x2019;s Resistance Army, are hunting down elephants and using the tusks to buy weapons.&#xA;Some suggest that poaching be limited by providing a regulated supply of ivory gathered by the stockpiling of tusks from culls and natural deaths. But past experience - a one-off sale of legal ivory to China in 2008 - shows this approach actually worsens poaching.&#xA;Armies and former soldiers are working in the field to help protect elephants. Some have suggested staining the ivory; cameras and trackers have even been embedded within the tusk; others have arranged for tusks to be removed pre-emptively by conservationists.&#xA;Throughout my year I met both former and current poachers. I met dozens of locals living on the border of the national and private parks, forced into poaching for survival. I met fathers who admitted killing elephants to feed their children. While there is undoubtedly a distinction between the locals who kill, hunt and poach for survival and the organised crime that is decimating the wild populations, Africa&#x2019;s wildlife and those who protect it are now on the frontline. The state-sponsored anti-poaching patrols are outnumbered and outgunned.&#xA;Throughout my year, I never saw a single anti-poaching unit in any of the national parks, compared to the relatively well-trained and -equipped security guards employed by the private parks.&#xA;Many locals in east Africa are calling for fences to separate wildlife and people. They argue it will reduce conflict and also make it easier to protect the wildlife from poachers. From my experience in Tanzania, no fence and no militia will hold back the tide of poachers drawn by the huge sums of money at stake. It is a trade partly born out of inequality.&#xA;Unless we can ensure the locals benefit from the wildlife in their front garden, they will continue to exploit it. About 35,000 African elephants are poached every year; that&#x2019;s one elephant every 15 minutes. At this rate, they will soon become extinct.

Photograph: Yin Bogu/Xinhua Press/Corbis&#xA;Texas senator Ted Cruz finally showed us what Donald Trump&#x2019;s face looks like when he loses in a poll-defying victory over the real estate tycoon that his campaign hopes will give him stronger momentum in New Hampshire, where Trump&#x2019;s lead in the first-in-the-nation primaries is much more commanding than it was in Iowa.&#xA;With 99.9% of votes in, Cruz held a 27.7% to 24.3% lead over Trump, with Rubio at 23.1%. None of the other Republican candidates broke into the double digits: Dr. Ben Carson went home to get new clothes after winning 9.3% of the delegates; Rand Paul won 4.5%; Jeb Bush, who spent a king&#x2019;s ransom in Iowa, won only 2.8%; every other candidate won less than two percent of overall delegate support, prompting former Arkansas governor and one-time Iowa caucus winner Mike Huckabee to suspend his campaign.&#xA;&#x2014; Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 2, 2016&#xA;I am officially suspending my campaign. Thank you for all your loyal support. #ImWithHucK&#xA;In a ( very, very lengthy ) victory speech, Cruz declared his caucus win as a victory for &#x201c;courageous conservatives&#x201d; across the state and the country.&#xA;&#x201c;Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists, but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force where all sovereignty resides in our nation: by we the people, the American people,&#x201d; Cruz said.&#xA;Cruz&#x2019;s victory, declared relatively early in the night, led many to wonder what, exactly, a Trump concession speech even looked like. The candidate, famous for deriding losers, was now a loser.&#xA;The experience seemed to have been a humbling one for Trump, who congratulated Cruz in his concession speech. &#x201c;On June 16, when we started this journey, I was told by everybody, do not go to Iowa . They said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do it.&#x2019; I said I have to do it.&#xA;&#x201c;And we finished second, and let me tell you something, I&#x2019;m honored, I&#x2019;m just honored ... We&#x2019;re just so happy with the way everything&#x2019;s worked out.&#x201d;&#xA;He praised Iowa and Iowans, adding what might be the biggest whopper dropped on the campaign trail this cycle:&#xA;&#x2014; Scott Bixby (@scottbix) February 2, 2016&#xA;&quot;We will be back many, many times &#x2014; in fact, I think I might come here and buy a farm,&quot; Trump lies.&#xA;Trump&#x2019;s disappointment was compounded by how close he came to third place - senator Marco Rubio , who wasn&#x2019;t expected to pull past the low teens, was only a little more than a percentage point away in the final delegate count, which may have accounted for what many called the third-place finisher&#x2019;s victory speech.&#xA;&#x201c;So this is the moment they said would never happen,&#x201d; Rubio told a raucous crowd. &#x201c;For months, they told us we had no chance.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;They told me I needed to wait my turn. They told me we had no chance because my hair wasn&#x2019;t gray enough and my boots were too high,&#x201d; he said, referring to a flurry of shady campaign commentary about his Cuban heel boots . &#x201c;But tonight, here in Iowa, the people of this great state have sent a very clear message after seven years of Barack Obama: we are not waiting any longer.&#x201d;&#xA;Updated&#xA;"/>

The Nationals are likely to get an additional position in cabinet in the reshuffle, taking their representation to four.&#xA;Nationals sources say Joyce has the numbers in their party room but there is a strong minority who are actively opposed to him getting the job.&#xA;Another possible contender, supported by the &#x201c;anybody but Barnaby&#x201d; camp, is the NSW MP Michael McCormack. But McCormack is more often mentioned as a candidate for deputy leader, alongside the Victorian Darren Chester and the NSW MP Luke Hartsuyker.&#xA;At the moment there are three Nationals in cabinet &#x2013; Truss as the infrastructure minister, Joyce as the agriculture minister and the senator Nigel Scullion as the minister for Indigenous affairs.&#xA;Related: Warren Truss asserts Nationals' demand for more cabinet spots after defection&#xA;Nationals MPs have expressed frustration at the speculation about Truss&#x2019;s future.&#xA;McCormack said last week Truss would make the decision &#x201c;in the interests of the National Party ... it might sound glib but it&#x2019;s the honest truth, because this is how Warren Truss thinks &#x2013; he will do it with the nation&#x2019;s best interests at heart&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;s always led our party, that&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;ll continue to lead our party; and he&#x2019;s given nothing away and he has the full support of his 20 colleagues in the party room,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;McCormack said his own intentions were &#x201c;to continue to work hard on behalf of the people of the Riverina who elect me and, if and when Warren Truss decides to retire, then we&#x2019;ll see what happens then&#x201d;.&#xA;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s absolutely no ring to be throwing any hat into at the moment and until that time comes then I&#x2019;m just going to be continuing to do my job,&#x201d; McCormack said.&#xA;The Labor senator Penny Wong has claimed Joyce is too &#x201c;erratic&#x201d; to be deputy prime minister.&#xA;&#x201c;He simply doesn&#x2019;t have the sober and sensible approach to public policy that Australians expect from the holders of high office,&#x201d; she said last month. &#x201c;Even Barnaby&#x2019;s own colleagues are worried about him taking on this role.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

Italy also deployed forces to Iraq as part of the US-led coalition that overthrew Saddam Hussein, and a truck bomb killed 19 Italians south of Baghdad in 2003.&#xA;Lt Gen Sean MacFarland, the commander of the military operation against Isis, said last week that the US had put measuring devices on the dam to monitor how much it is moving or deteriorating over time.&#xA;Since the dam&#x2019;s completion in 1984, the Iraqi government has sought to shore up the foundation by injecting mortar-like grout into the subsoil and cavities and controlling seepage.&#xA;But essential maintenance stopped in 2014 when Isis briefly seized the dam.&#xA;In 2007, the US ambassador to Iraq and the top American military commander in the country wrote a letter warning that the dam could fail with devastating results.&#xA;&#x201c;A catastrophic failure of the Mosul dam would result in flooding along the Tigris river all the way to Baghdad,&#x201d; the letter said.&#xA;&#x201c;Assuming a worst-case scenario, an instantaneous failure of Mosul dam filled to its maximum operating level could result in a flood wave 20 metres (66 feet) deep at the city of Mosul,&#x201d; it said.&#xA;"/>

He was eight years old and travelled with his brothers, Enrique (my father), aged 12, and Tomas, aged seven.&#xA;The 4,000 children and accompanying adults were the largest single arrival of refugees to the UK. From the canvas camp between Southampton and Eastleigh, in Hampshire, Juan Antonio moved to the colony for the children at Carshalton, Surrey. This home was supported by the council and local people who donated money, food and equipment and helped with the children&#x2019;s education and employment. The niños vascos were supported in Britain by the broadest alliance of churches, trade unions and political parties despite the opposition of the national government, whose policy was of non-intervention in Spain .&#xA;Juan Antonio&#x2019;s mother, Eloisa, stayed in Spain with his youngest brother, Poligno, and they were evacuated to Barcelona as the battle for Bilbao intensified. They returned to Bilbao when the war was lost. His father, Tomas, and eldest brother, Jose Luis, both fought in the war on the side of the Republic. His father was killed, but Jose Luis survived.&#xA;Juan Antonio worked on the chicken farm of one of the supporters of the Carshalton colony before turning to horticulture and finally to lorry driving. He was a skilled and practical man who loved his family, his garden and his cars. Eventually he settled in Crawley, West Sussex.&#xA;Juan Antonio and his brothers did not return to Spain after the war but were reunited with their mother and youngest brother in the 1940s and with their oldest brother in the 50s. Others of the children and the adults who accompanied them were reunited with their families in Spain or in exile, or made their lives where they could. His brother, Tomas, emigrated to Australia.&#xA;Juan Antonio is survived by his wife, Doris, whom he met at a garden fete organised to raise money for the colony; their children, Hazel, Peter, and Michael; by six grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren; and by Tomas.&#xA;"/>

She lost control and dropped 20ft off the piste and made contact with a tree.&#x201d;&#xA;The trio had arrived at La Plagne on Saturday and were enjoying their second full day in the mountains when the tragedy happened at about 11.30am on Monday. Medics pronounced Clayton dead at the scene, according to reports.&#xA;Clayton, a widow from Poynton, Cheshire, had dedicated herself to charity work since the death of her husband, Bob, 12 years ago. She was a keen volunteer with a night-time charity, the Manchester Street Angels , which helps vulnerable and lost people in the city at night and had also been to Bulgaria and Romania to deliver supplies with Operation Christmas Child.&#xA;Paying tribute to his mother, Stephen Clayton said: &#x201c;She really looked after us and was a really caring person. She also helped out at various food banks around our local area. She was known for her voluntary work.&#xA;&#x201c;Mum was very caring and would not do anything for herself unless it benefited other people. She was always ready to do a lot for others. She had a lot of close friends that we have had to tell. She was very popular. She loved life and just got things done.&#x201d;&#xA;An investigation into Clayton&#x2019;s death is under way at La Plagne, according to reports. Her sons are due to speak to French police about the incident. Pictures of the family on holiday showed them all wearing helmets and goggles.&#xA;Manchester Street Angels paid tribute to Clayton on its Facebook page: &#x201c;We share this news with a very heavy heart. Our very dear friend &amp; amazing angel has sadly passed away. God needed a true Angel to join him. Sending all our love to her family, friends &amp; fellow Angels.

Good progress last 24 hours but still outstanding issues&#xA;The publication of the document makes it more likely that a referendum can be held before the summer holidays, despite the SNP teaming up with some Conservative, Labour, Plaid and Lib Dem MPs to say it is too close to the May elections.&#xA;The prime minister will now need to convince his own party and the country that he has achieved the &#x201c;far-reaching , fundamental reforms&#x201d; he promised when he set out the strategy for a renegotiation before a referendum. Many arch-eurosceptic Tory backbenchers are unmoved, with Ann-Marie Trevelyan describing the proposed changes as trivial.&#xA;Cameron has been told it is not yet a done deal among other leaders and he will need to launch a diplomatic offensive in eastern Europe over the next two weeks to win Poland and its allies over to the plan to restrict benefit payments to EU migrants.&#xA;Beata Maria Szyd&#x142;o, the Polish prime minister, told Cameron in Warsaw late last year that Poland and the other three members of the Visegrád group &#x2013; Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia &#x2013; are opposed to any changes that will discriminate against their citizens working in the UK.&#xA;Related: Cameron&#x2019;s EU deal negotiations: the key questions answered&#xA;Downing Street was encouraged when Juncker agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Friday that an emergency brake to limit benefit payments to EU migrants for four years could be imposed as soon as a referendum is passed.&#xA;However, the proposal is causing concern among eastern European leaders, who fear a backlash among their citizens in the UK who still have the right to vote in domestic elections.&#xA;&#x201c;The prime minister will be focusing quite heavily on the Visegrád group over the next two weeks,&#x201d; one Whitehall source said. &#x201c;It is clear that there are nerves about how Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and workers from the Baltic states working in the UK might vote in elections back home.&#x201d;&#xA;Cameron is expected to brief the cabinet on Tuesday morning on the state of his negotiations with Tusk, who hopes to reach a deal at the next European council meeting on 18-19 February.&#xA;A failure to reach agreement could lead Tusk to convene a second, extra summit by the first week of March to allow Cameron to hold an in/out referendum on Britain&#x2019;s EU membership on his preferred date of 23 June.&#xA;One UK source said: &#x201c;Things seem to be moving in the right direction. But there&#x2019;s many a slip &#x2018;twixt the cup and the lip.&#x201d;&#xA;The prime minister will give a detailed response to Tusk&#x2019;s statement on Tuesday. No 10 sought to highlight progress by saying that the prime minister had secured agreement on one of his demands set out in the Conservative general election manifesto &#x2013; a red card system that will allow a group of national parliaments to club together to block EU legislation.&#xA;Under Tusk&#x2019;s draft agreement, 55% of the EU&#x2019;s national parliaments could force the European council to stop or amend legislation they believe is unnecessary. A No 10 source said: &#x201c;This will strengthen the power of Westminster to stop unnecessary EU laws and addresses concerns that the current yellow card system has not proved strong enough. It ensures that the European commission cannot just ignore the will of national parliamentarians and delivers greater democratic control over what the EU does.&#x201d;&#xA;The red card system has been relatively uncontroversial in the negotiations. The more difficult areas have been the prime minister&#x2019;s plan to ban EU migrants from claiming in-work benefits for four years. Downing Street says the emergency brake would have to be as effective as the prime minister&#x2019;s original proposal of a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits.&#xA;No 10 indicated that more work was needed on the chancellor, George Osborne&#x2019;s demands for non-eurozone countries to be given protections from rules drawn up for the single market.&#xA;Downing Street said the UK was looking for a watertight &#x201c;enforcement mechanism&#x201d;, though not a veto, to allow non-eurozone members to flag up concerns. This could involve contentious legislation being referred to EU leaders on the European council. France is nervous because no member state has a veto over the rules of the single market, while each EU leader has a veto on the European council.&#xA;More work was also needed to stop non-EU citizens getting access to Britain through &#x201c;sham marriages&#x201d;. Non-EU citizens who marry a UK citizen have no automatic right to settle in the UK, but if they marry a citizen of another EU country they can move to the UK under the EU&#x2019;s rules on free movement.&#xA;"/>

Five years into the crisis, their savings are exhausted, they are struggling to get aid, and they are increasingly unable to support themselves and their families.&#xA;&#x201c;We must do everything we can to lift the legal and financial barriers that prevent Syrian refugees from working. Syrian refugees deserve not just a life but a life worth living.&#x201d;&#xA;Proposing 200,000 work permits in both Lebanon and Jordan as well as 600,000 in Turkey, he added: &#x201c;The conference has to end the fiction that the Syrian civil war is going to end any time soon.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Syrian refugee crisis: why has it become so bad?&#xA;Thursday&#x2019;s conference will be attended by officials from around the world including from Iran&#x2019;s foreign minister; the first visit by the Iranians to London for 12 years. It aims to raise funds for a multibillion-dollar UN appeal for 2016 and redirect the aid focus on to jobs and education for the refugees as well as humanitarian access inside Syria .&#xA;On Monday UN officials said placing towns in Syria under siege was a potential war crime that could be prosecuted. There were reports that the Syrian government would allow another aid convoy into Madaya, one of the worst-affected besieged towns, where aid agencies say residents have been dying of starvation.&#xA;Britain&#x2019;s foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, was in Jordan on Monday to try to persuade the government in Amman to offer work permits in return for EU trade concessions and additional global aid. The issue is controversial in Jordan, where the economy is being upended by the scale of the refugee crisis.&#xA;King Abdullah of Jordan on Tuesday warned the country cannot continue to take in Syrian refugees unless it receives significant help. &#x201c;The psyche of the Jordanian people, I think it&#x2019;s gotten to a boiling point,&#x201d; he told the BBC. &#x201c;Sooner or later, I think the dam is going to burst and I think this week is going to be very important for Jordanians to see, is there going to be help - not only for Syrian refugees, but for their own future as well.&#x201d;&#xA;Jordan&#x2019;s prime minister, Abdullah Ensour, said on Monday his government might provide 150,000 work permits over several years in return for Jordan receiving $1.6bn over three years to fund its schools, healthcare and jobs infrastructure. The work would be distributed equally between Jordanians and Syrians.&#xA;In Geneva, the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura met Syrian opposition officials, but a planned session with the government team was postponed. It had already seen De Mistura on Friday when the long-awaited negotiations got under way.&#xA;&#x201c;This is the official beginning of the Geneva talks,&#x201d; said De Mistura. He said the opposition &#x201c;are insisting that the Syrian people, while we are having talks on the future of a political solutiondeserve to hear and see a reduction in the violence on the ground. We feel they have a very strong point.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: Destitute Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon may return to warzone&#xA;The UN envoy said he would be meeting the Syrian government team on Tuesday morning and the opposition again later in the day.&#xA;Opposition negotiators repeated their demand for the implementation of a UN resolution calling for end to airstrikes and sieges and for humanitarian access and the release of detainees before they would enter into substantive discussions. De Mistura has said he plans to run proximity talks, shuttling between the two Syrian parties because of the unbridgeable gaps between them.&#xA;The anti-Assad team was awaiting the arrival of its chief negotiator, Mohammed Alloush, representative of the Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) group, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and tolerated by western governments but considered terrorist by Bashar al-Assad. It controls the countryside east of Damascus.&#xA;Other Syrian rebel groups have issued a statement expressing support for the opposition negotiators, who are anxious to achieve results to justify their presence in Geneva while Syrian government and Russian airstrikes continue. The opposition is under heavy pressure from the US and Britain to participate fully in the talks.&#xA;"/>

The country spends 2.2% of its GDP on care for the elderly, second only to Sweden, and Danes over the age of 65 receive a basic pension of about 8,000 krone (£811) a month, before tax.&#xA;Those without a private pension or any other income are entitled to extra benefits, such as cheaper medicine or more favourable tax rates.&#xA;The rights of the elderly are championed by senior citizen councils in each municipality, and leaders from Denmark&#x2019;s five geographical regions meet with local authorities and practitioners to plan improvements to services every three years.&#xA;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re well informed about our rights, we&#x2019;ve paid our taxes and so we expect to be looked after,&#x201d; says Jane Holm, 73, a former administrator from Copenhagen. &#x201c;Everyone I know is pretty healthy but when my mother-in-law couldn&#x2019;t clean or look after herself any more and had to go into a home &#x2013; aged 95 &#x2013; she was very well treated.&#x201d;&#xA;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re taken care of as an elderly person in Denmark,&#x201d; agrees Rigmor Brønd, 73, a former teacher from Kolding. &#x201c;I feel great right now, but I know that if I have problems, the state will look after me &#x2013; to stay in my own home, or in a nursing home where I can have a good life.&#x201d;&#xA;Carsten Hendriksen is a geriatrician and former associate professor at the University of Copenhagen who contributed to many of the laws that protect old people in Denmark. These include legislation to increase the number of home visits and guidelines on preventative care.&#xA;We recognise that it&#x2019;s better and cheaper to keep people healthy at home&#xA;He says there are three categories of older people: the healthy (about six in seven Danes fall into this category); those showing early signs of functional limitations whom doctors keep a close eye on, as early intervention can still make a difference; and the final category, which includes those with serious mobility issues who may need to go into a home. &#x201c;In Denmark, you pay for a nursing home as an individual out of your pension &#x2013; just like renting a flat,&#x201d; says Hendriksen.&#xA;A centralised e-health database where patient records are stored electronically helps hospitals and local authorities collaborate to improve care. All 80-year-olds are entitled to home visits to assess their needs, and over-65s who have been widowed are monitored to see if they need help. Neither service is means-tested. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had success with these measures,&#x201d; says Hendriksen. &#x201c;Numbers in this second group have also decreased in recent years.&#x201d;&#xA;Nursing homes tend to be council-run, with even private institutions inspected by local authorities and subsidised to bring prices in line with state institutions. &#x201c;You pay about 5,000 krone a month for a nursing home plus the cost of any meals or cleaning,&#x201d; says Hendriksen. If this is unaffordable, the council evaluate your financial situation and offer assistance based on the size of your pension. Those who stay in their own home are also well supported.&#xA;&#x201c;We recognise that it&#x2019;s better and cheaper to keep people healthy at home,&#x201d; says Hendriksen. &#x201c;So you get money to modify your property and you&#x2019;ll be offered home help &#x2013; regardless of how much money you have.&#x201d;&#xA;Taking care of the whole of society has long been part of the Scandinavian tradition, and as a small, wealthy nation, Denmark has been able to make changes more easily than might be possible in other countries.&#xA;&#x201c;So far, the system seems to be working,&#x201d; says Hendriksen, who retired three months ago. &#x201c;You hear stories about hospitals or care homes forgetting to look more broadly at an old person&#x2019;s needs. But the theory is that they should try to. And, mostly, they do.&#x201d;&#xA;Topics&#xA;"/>

Photograph: Social media&#xA;Tuesday 2 February 2016 06.00 GMT&#xA;Last modified on Tuesday 2 February 2016 11.53 GMT&#xA;Share on WhatsApp&#xA;One day in late June 2001, Rosario Porto, a petite, dark-haired lawyer from Santiago de Compostela, northern Spain , sat nervously on a flight to China beside her husband Alfonso Basterra, a quiet man from the Basque country, who worked as a freelance journalist. The couple, both in their mid-30s, were on their way to adopt a baby girl. Porto swallowed two tablets of Orfidal &#x2013; a common anti-anxiety medicine that she had used before then &#x2013; but remained too agitated and excited to sleep.&#xA;The couple had had no trouble persuading local Spanish authorities that they would make good parents and that their child would be surrounded by a loving extended family. Porto&#x2019;s father was a lawyer who had been honorary consul for France in Santiago, and her mother was a university lecturer in history of art. They had given their daughter a flat that occupied a whole floor of a four-storey block in what some call Santiago&#x2019;s &#x201c;VIP zone&#x201d;, home to the city&#x2019;s upper middle class. The flat was decorated in the bold tones &#x2013; blues, greens and yellows &#x2013; that Porto liked, and full of art, curiosities and colourful rugs from around the world. The child&#x2019;s bedroom would have wallpaper covered in clouds and suns.&#xA;At that time, adopting from China was unusual. Nobody in Santiago, a solidly bourgeois city of 93,000 people , had done so before, and only a few Chinese children had been adopted in the wider region of Galicia, a mostly rural area of 2.7 million people. But Spanish parents wanting to adopt were beginning to cast a wide net. With a plummeting birth rate and strict adoption laws, there were relatively few Spanish children needing homes, while adopting abroad was relatively quick and easy &#x2013; at least for couples who could afford the costs of &#x20ac;10,000 or more. By 2004, Spain would rank second in the world for foreign adoptions &#x2013; behind only the United States. The following year, adoptions of Chinese children peaked at 2,750. Of these children, 95% were girls (the one-child policy placed an added premium on boys).&#xA;Membership Event: Guardian Live | An evening with the Long Read&#xA;Adopting a baby girl from abroad brought the satisfaction and, for some, the moral cachet of rescuing a child in need. In the progressive, cultured environment in which the Basterra Porto family moved, they could expect nothing but praise. Porto, who inherited her father&#x2019;s role as honorary consul, even appeared on local television to share her wisdom and experience about adopting.&#xA;Psychologists&#x2019; reports painted a positive picture of the couple. Porto was &#x201c;friendly, relaxed, emotionally expressive, cooperative, adaptable and solicitous,&#x201d; they said. &#x201c;I am a passionate woman,&#x201d; she told them, describing her husband as &#x201c;patient, easy-going, understanding and with a sense of humour, a strong character who makes his own decisions.&#x201d; The Porto family, one of their friends told me, were &#x201c;aristocracy&#x201d;.&#xA;In China, an underweight, undersized nine-month-old baby girl from Hunan province called Asunta Fong Yang awaited them. It was, Basterra would recall, &#x201c;an incredible trip&#x201d;. Two weeks later, after navigating the Chinese red tape and making the required payments, they brought the little girl home to Santiago. Her new Spanish identity documents showed that she was now Asunta Fong Yang Basterra Porto.&#xA;The child grew and began to gain weight, though she remained slight and suffered the routine ailments of childhood: fevers, gastroenteritis and other illnesses that scare parents but pass quickly. In the circles in which Porto &#x2013; &#x201c;Charo&#x201d; to friends and family &#x2013; moved, friendly doctors were always on hand. There was no need to go to the public health centre, where a paediatrician had been assigned to Asunta. They went, instead, to the city&#x2019;s major hospital, where a friendly consultant would oversee future care. Even prescription-only medicines could be obtained from friendly pharmacists. It was a privilege of class, but this was how things worked in Santiago &#x2013; a charming, tranquil city that functions as the capital of the increasingly self-governing region of Galicia. &#x201c;Like other provincial cities, Santiago can be very complacent,&#x201d; the Galician writer Miguel Anxo Murado told me. The couple were happy to use their contacts. They were simply doing their best for Asunta.&#xA;Over time it became apparent that Asunta was special. By the time she reached secondary school she was deemed so bright that she skipped an academic year. Her parents both pushed her and fretted about her abilities. &#x201c;Well-handled, they are a good thing,&#x201d; Porto told friends after reading up on gifted children. &#x201c;But they can be a problem.&#x201d; There were private classes in English, French and Chinese, plus German at school. Asunta already spoke Spanish and Galician, the Portuguese-tinged language of this green, damp corner of Atlantic Spain. There were also private classes in ballet, violin and piano &#x2013; often demanded by Asunta herself.&#xA;&#x201c;She once told us what her Saturdays were like,&#x201d; Asunta&#x2019;s ballet teacher, an English woman named Gail Brevitt, recalled. &#x201c;She got up at 7am, did Chinese from 8 until 10, came to ballet from 10.15 to 12.30, then did French until lunchtime. And then there was violin and piano.&#x201d; Asunta&#x2019;s proud parents followed her progress carefully. The girl was timid with strangers, but exuberant at home &#x2013; playing practical jokes, haranguing her parents with mock political speeches or flouncing around in her ballet costumes. There were concerts and theatre trips, while her mother became involved in the Ateneo, a liberal cultural club that arranged talks, debates and concerts.&#xA;On Saturday, she got up at 7, did Chinese from 8 until 10, came to ballet from 10.15 to 12.30, then did French&#xA;By the time she turned 12 in September 2012, Asunta might have been expected to be getting fed up with being, to all appearances, a project child &#x2013; someone who was determinedly being shaped into a prodigy. Once, when her mother was going through a list of after-school activities in front of acquaintances, the girl snapped: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one that I&#x2019;m doing because you like it!&#x201d; But mostly Asunta seemed happy. She was talented, disciplined and enjoyed what she did. She was also reserved, sharing her few concerns with Carmen González, the family&#x2019;s cleaner and nanny, or with her elderly but active godmother, María Isabel Veliz. She was now five inches taller than Porto, and on the verge of womanhood. &#x201c;To me they seemed an idyllic family,&#x201d; said González.&#xA;* * *&#xA;But the family had started to show some cracks. In 2009, Porto spent two nights in a private psychiatric hospital, saying she felt suicidal, apathetic and guilty. Her mind was a high-speed whirl, she said, and she felt in competition with her own mother. &#x201c;She [Porto] gets very irritable with her daughter, who is a bother,&#x201d; a psychiatrist wrote in her notes. After two days, however, Porto discharged herself and only returned for one of the regular checkups that had been scheduled for her.&#xA;Two years later, in 2011, Porto had recovered her balance and began to think about sending her daughter away to school in England for a year. This would allow her to polish her English and help ensure that Asunta lived up to her natural brilliance. Porto had done something similar, spending a year at school in Oxford as a teenager and, as a 22-year-old student, travelling to France as an Erasmus exchange student. She had lasted only a few months in France. &#x201c;Nobody knew who I was. Here in Santiago, as my father was a faculty teacher, they treated me with greater consideration,&#x201d; she explained later. Her self-esteem was brittle, and it was during her time in France that a cycle of occasional tailspins into acute anxiety or depression had started. Porto began working in her father&#x2019;s law practice after graduating and later posted a CV online in which she claimed to have completed her Erasmus year and studied at the London High School of Law, an institution that does not exist.&#xA;In September 2013, aged 12, Asunta started back at school after a long summer holiday that included several happy weeks with her nanny in her home village and with her godmother at a local beach resort, swimming in the sea and going to local fiestas. &#x201c;She had a wonderful time,&#x201d; said Veliz. Her parents were nearby in Santiago or at their own beach apartment, but spent only a week of that six-week period with Asunta. They were recovering from an emotionally draining 18 months. This black period had started with the deaths of Porto&#x2019;s mother and, seven months later, her father. Both had died in their beds. Asunta had spent lots of time with her grandparents, strolling through the city&#x2019;s Alameda park with her grandfather, who would walk her home from ballet class. Her maternal grandmother had been the family&#x2019;s driving force. She had &#x201c;a personality like a lawnmower&#x201d;, said one acquaintance. Porto called her &#x201c;charmingly awful&#x201d;.&#xA;The losses exposed the faultlines in Porto&#x2019;s marriage. Early in 2013, she and Basterra had suddenly divorced, much to the surprise of their friends. In fact, Porto&#x2019;s enthusiasm for a man she saw as excessively puritan, antisocial, apathetic and unpredictable had run out long before. She admitted to a friend that she had tired of her underachieving &#x201c;house-husband&#x201d;. Porto had taken a lover &#x2013; a self-assured, energetic and successful businessman called Manuel García. When Basterra discovered the affair, after rummaging through his wife&#x2019;s emails, the marriage crumbled. He moved away, staying with relatives in the Basque country, but returned three weeks later, taking a tiny apartment around the corner. His only aim, he said, was to see Asunta grow up happy.&#xA;Porto had sat Asunta down and given her the divorced parents&#x2019; talk, full of reassurances that her parents adored her but that mummy and daddy no longer loved each other. &#x201c;So who will cook?&#x201d; Asunta wanted to know. It was a pertinent question. Her father, whose freelance work was erratic, had been chef and chief housekeeper. Basterra bombarded his ex-wife with emails reminding her of all the household tasks that would now fall on her, knowing that her inability to organise herself would make her anxious. &#x201c;I doubt if she has ever even boiled an egg,&#x201d; said one friend. Without Porto&#x2019;s money, Basterra had come down in the world. His wife&#x2019;s choice of lover &#x2013; García, who was still married and who Basterra regarded as vulgar &#x2013; only added to his sense of resentment.&#xA;No one knows how Asunta, entering adolescence, reacted to all this. The perfect certainties of her world were being dismantled, and her trust in her parents must have been shaken.&#xA;"/>

As she drove the two miles to the Jubilee Palace she passed two huge gilded aluminium lions erected in her honour.&#xA;Halfway on the journey they changed from a car to a state coach drawn by six white horses. Surrounded by a 100 horsemen of the imperial bodyguard, jogging under heavy lion&#x2019;s mane helmets, it took more than an hour to drive the two miles through crowd clapping a rhythmic welcome and drums thumping. Horsemen cantered among the crowd with even longer lions&#x2019; manes stuck to their hair.&#xA;State banquet&#xA;Later the Queen was guest of honour at a state banquet in the old palace, where in the gardens the Emperor keeps his pet lions. By then she could be in no doubt that she had come to the land of the Lion of Judah, King of Kings.&#xA;The welcome, all the same, was gay and unforced. The traffic jams began two hours before her plane arrived, and it was noticeable how pedestrians who had armed themselves with spears made the best progress.&#xA;Her palace looks out upon the handsome African Hall where many times in the past 18 months African leaders have met to denounce the colonial Powers and to plan the liberation of Southern Africa . But a banner strung across the road proclaims &#x201c;Long live the friendship between Great Britain and Ethiopia.&#x201d; And behind her palace are roads named after three British generals - Wavell, Wingate, and Cunningham - who helped to liberate Ethiopia from the Italians.&#xA;Tonight, Britain was in Ethiopian eyes the great country and a liberator rather than a colonialist. Many of the soldiers at the airport wore the British Africa Star.&#xA;The state visit is being made in return for one paid to London by the Emperor when Sir Winston Churchill was Prime Minister ten years ago. Britain was also host to the Emperor and his family while he fretted out four years of exile in a country house near Bath.&#xA;Ancient glories&#xA;For a week, Ethiopia is prepared to be unashamedly imperial. Today&#x2019;s Issue of the &#x201c;Ethiopian Gazette&#x201d; carefully notes that the six white horses drawing the state coach were bred from the stable of the Emperor Maximilian, famous 300 years ago.&#xA;During the week the accent will be mainly on the country&#x2019;s ancient glories, with a night spent camping above the old capital of Gondar. But the Queen is also to see new glories, such as the huge Tendaho cotton estates, one of the few pieces of British enterprise in Ethiopia. It is the successful vision of Mitchell Cotts, and that company&#x2019;s 10,000 British shareholders.&#xA;The Queen&#x2019;s arrival has inspired the capital&#x2019;s only daily newspaper to inaugurate a women&#x2019;s page, and in this the Queen is praised as a monarch who has shown interest in industry and patronised the arts. There is little doubt that the Queen, who added to today&#x2019;s brightness by wearing a buttercup yellow coat and petal hat, will wipe out the somewhat frosty memory most Ethiopians have of the British monarchy.&#xA;No one in public speeches is likely to mention the unhappy events of a century ago, when the Emperor Theodore felt himself slighted in correspondence with Queen Victoria, and the incident ended with a British punitive expedition and the Emperor dying after battle. Today&#x2019;s horsemen looked as if they had galloped out of the last century, but their welcome belonged to this happier age.&#xA;The Queen has invested Emperor Haile Selassie with the honorary rank of field-marshal in the British Army. The only other monarch in the world to hold this British rank is the King of Nepal.&#xA;Topics&#xA;"/>

Part of the reason the WHO has named the virus a public health emergency of international concern is to provoke more rapid research to determine if the link is causal.&#xA;Professor Cameron Simmons from the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, said the virus was not new in Australia&#x2019;s neighbourhood.&#xA;&#x201c;The South American outbreak had its origins in the Pacific islands, so this virus has been going around our region, including countries like Indonesia, for several years now,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;&#x201c;But it seems that only when it arrived in South America did we see this large-scale outbreak, likely because there is no population immunity. But we don&#x2019;t really know why a virus that has arrived in Latin America has taken off in this way, while a similar one in Indonesia doesn&#x2019;t reach the same epidemic status.&#x201d;&#xA;It could be that there were more mosquitos and a higher population density in Brazil , prompting more transmission of Zika, Simmons said. Microcephaly is extremely rare, so it could also be that it took a large Zika outbreak for the suspected complication to become noticeable in a population, he added.&#xA;He added that microcephaly, which has a number of causes, was not monitored very closely in Brazil until the Zika outbreak. There was a chance people were assuming a link between Zika and microcephaly, which was now being monitored more closely. However, the evidence for a link is growing stronger, he said. It was likely microcephaly data in south-east Asian countries would also be examined retrospectively to see if a link between microcephaly and Zika had been missed there.&#xA;Researchers will also examine whether there is a genetic difference in the populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitos in south-east Asia and Latin America, with that species the main transmitter of the Zika virus, Simmons said.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Australia has the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries dengue, yellow fever and the Zika virus. Health experts say an outbreak of the Zika virus is highly unlikely in Australia. Photograph: Juan Carlos Ulate/Reuters&#xA;The risk of Zika coming to Australia is extremely low. Australia has the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also the same mosquito which carries dengue and yellow fever. But Zika is not circulating in Australia&#x2019;s mosquito population.&#xA;Related: Brazil still unsure of how bad the country's Zika virus outbreak is&#xA;Because Australian health authorities have strong experience managing dengue fever cases, which were often imported from people visiting or returning from overseas rather than arising locally, cases of Zika in Australia have also been well controlled.&#xA;While the Asian tiger mosquito can also spread Zika, it is not found in Australia and stringent quarantine measures means it is unlikely to arrive here, especially in numbers high enough and carrying the disease to trigger an outbreak.&#xA;For an outbreak to occur in Australia, someone infected with Zika would have to be bitten at the right stage of infection by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the virus would then have to replicate in the mosquito, and that mosquito would then have to bite enough people to prompt an outbreak. While an outbreak was not impossible, it would likely be small and well contained, virologists have said.&#xA;Australia&#x2019;s main role in the outbreak would be to contribute knowledge towards finding out more about the virus, preventing its spread, and helping to find a vaccine if the link between Zika and microcephaly was confirmed, Associate Professor Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said.&#xA;&#x201c;Australia has some really fantastic researchers in this space, particularly at the University of Queensland and at James Cook University, who can meet the need for increased research into Zika and a microcephaly link,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;&#x201c;Researchers will examine, among many things, whether the genetics of the virus has changed over time.&#x201d;&#xA;Director of the Marie Bashir Institute at the University of Sydney, Professor Tania Sorrell, said Australian experts could assist in the application of diagnostics tests and expertise in developing vaccines.&#xA;&#x201c;However, the World Health Organisation is there to direct the effort and contributions from various countries, and North America is already making a major contribution,&#x201d; she said.&#xA;Related: How can the world fight Zika &#x2013; silent menace that threatens the unborn?&#xA;&#x201c;In the mean time, Australians travelling to affected countries are being encouraged to take Deet-based mosquito repellants with them, because we know those products are the most effective repellants but they may be harder to find in poorly resourced countries. You only need one bite from infected mosquitos to get an infection, and it is important to apply the repellant as soon as you go outside, as these mosquitos bite all day and not just at dusk and night.&#x201d;&#xA;The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised pregnant women to reconsider travel to any area where outbreaks of the mosquito-transmitted Zika virus have occurred, while pregnant women who have recently travelled to areas of Zika virus transmission and who are ill are also being advised to see a doctor.&#xA;On Tuesday the Queensland health minister, Cameron Dick, said he would convene a roundtable discussion this week, which would include experts in infectious diseases and disease control.&#xA;Public health experts, including chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young, Indigenous health experts and forensic services officers would also attend.&#xA;&#x201c;The advice that I have is Queensland is at no great threat of this virus, but it is spreading,&#x201d; Dick said. &#x201c;I want to give Queenslanders confidence that we are doing everything we can to be prepared and we will bring those experts together ... to keep Queenslanders safe.&#x201d;&#xA;Dick said monitoring was already under way in the Torres Strait to ensure any cases were detected early. Residents in the state&#x2019;s far north were also being urged to take preventative action, including destroying mosquito breeding sites.&#xA;Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press&#xA;"/>

The problem with the Russians is while they are talking they are bombing, and they are supporting Assad,&#x201d; Hammond said.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond, centre, during his visit to Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. Photograph: Muhammad Hamed/Reuters&#xA;Russia says it targets a range of militants in Syria, not just Islamic State , although it insists it focuses on Isis. Russian officials say the west is playing with fire by trying to topple Assad.&#xA;On Monday, Russia&#x2019;s defence ministry said it had conducted 468 air strikes in Syria in the past week and hit more than 1,300 &#x201c;terrorist&#x201d; targets, Russian news agencies reported. The ministry also said it had delivered more than 200 tonnes of aid to the besieged Syrian town of Deir ez-Zor in January.&#xA;But rebels and residents say the Russian air strikes are causing hundreds of civilian casualties in indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas away from the frontline.&#xA;Related: Zaatari's children: life in a refugee camp - picture essay&#xA;&#x201c;Since the Russian intervention in Syria, the dribble of people who were perhaps going back from these camps to Syria has stopped dead, and there is a new flow coming in because of the actions the Russians are taking &#x2013; particularly in southern Syria along the border just a few kilometres from here,&#x201d; Hammond said.&#xA;Russia&#x2019;s intervention had been a major setback for international efforts to find a political solution to the crisis, Hammond said. The effect of the intervention was to strengthen Islamic State, he added.&#xA;&#x201c;The Russians say they want to destroy Daesh but they are not bombing Daesh: they are bombing the moderate opposition,&#x201d; Hammond said, using an Arabic acronym for Isis.&#xA;&#x201c;Less than 30% of Russian strikes are against Daesh targets,&#x201d; Hammond said. &#x201c;Their intervention is strengthening Daesh on the ground, doing the very opposite of what they claim to be wanting to achieve.&#x201d;&#xA;But he said it was difficult to discern whether the Kremlin&#x2019;s support for Assad was changing, because Putin was impossible to read.&#xA;Related: UK welcomes Syrian opposition decision to join peace talks&#xA;&#x201c;The thing I have learned watching Putin, first as defence secretary and now as foreign secretary, is that it doesn&#x2019;t matter how much you watch, you cannot see anything: completely inscrutable,&#x201d; he said.&#xA;&#x201c;We have no idea what the game plan in the Kremlin is. We don&#x2019;t know. There are no councils discussing these things. It is what is going on Mr Putin&#x2019;s head.&#x201d;&#xA;Asked if the Iranians were being more helpful than the Russians, he said: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think either of them is being particularly helpful to the peace process.&#xA;&#x201c;The Russians and the Iranians are working hand in glove with the Syrian regime, and the Iranians are at least as hardline as the Russians about seeking to ensure the preservation of the Syrian regime.&#x201d;&#xA;Topics&#xA;"/>

During the trip, he also told the exiled Crimean Tatar leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, that Crimea would eventually be returned to Ukraine .&#xA;In a Facebook post on Monday , Kasyanov called the crosshairs video a &#x201c;direct threat of a murder motivated by political hatred&#x201d; and said President Vladimir Putin, who appointed Kadyrov in 2007, &#x201c;bears personal responsibility for Kadyrov&#x2019;s actions&#x201d; and should condemn them.&#xA;Instagram deleted the crosshairs video for violating its rule that users respect one another, a spokesperson told Vedomosti newspaper.&#xA;The RPR-Parnas deputy chairman, Vladimir Kara-Murza, seen walking with Kasyanov in the video, called it an &#x201c;instigation to murder&#x201d;.&#xA;Kara-Murza said he was the victim of a poisoning attempt similar to that of Alexander Litvinenko after he suffered sudden illness and organ failure in May, as a result of which he now walks with a cane.&#xA;Related: Traitors, jackals and vile liberals: Ramzan Kadyrov's insults decoded&#xA;The video is the latest attack in Kadyrov&#x2019;s war of words against Russia&#x2019;s liberal opposition, which has been increasingly marginalised since tensions with the west began rising in 2014.

Run-off from the waste contaminates Lima&#x2019;s main water source, the Rimac river, as well as with the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the bay of Lima.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;A live GPS map tracks the vultures&#xA;The environmental supervision agency OEFA says that three poorer neighbourhoods, despite having only 12% of Lima&#x2019;s population, have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4,%), Villa El Salvador (25.3 %) and El Agustino (18.3%).&#xA;The problem, in part, is unpaid taxes. Many residents, especially in the barrios, just don&#x2019;t pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities lack the resources for basic services such as rubbish collection.&#xA;It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash. &#x201c;We share the vulture&#x2019;s GPS coordinates with the municipalities,&#x201d; says Javier Hernandez, the project director. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents.&#x201d;&#xA;The project aims to encourage citizens to be &#x201c;vultures on the ground&#x201d;: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste, and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illicit dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page .&#xA;Footage taken by Basan, one of the 10 participating vultures&#xA;The idea was hatched at the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP20, hosted in Lima. &#x201c;We were looking for ways to involve not just the authorities but also citizens to generate environmental awareness,&#x201d; Hernandez says. Artist Cristina Planas had placed huge, sculpted vulture heads on top of 25 dead palm trees in a wetland reserve in the south of the city. Rich residents hated it as an ugly imposition, but Planas invited citizens to &#x201c;adopt a vulture&#x201d; in support of conservation and recycling.&#xA;&#x201c;We are a little scared of the vulture&#x2019;s appearance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But in reality, he is out there sacrificing himself for us. He is out there recycling, in the last place we threw out our rubbish.&#x201d;&#xA;Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion&#xA;Topics&#xA;"/>

But neither is it a state of affairs one can dismiss casually. Every last one of those 10 billion human beings is going to need a place to live.&#xA;And wherever that place should happen to be, it won&#x2019;t be in the cities we&#x2019;re presently familiar with. However trendy &#x201c;urban infill&#x201d; and densification may be in our faculties of architecture, polities in the developed world are no longer willing to countenance the kind of conditions that inevitably result when hundreds of thousands of human bodies are packed into every square mile. The residential housing densities of New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side circa 1905, for example, among the highest ever recorded, were achieved by housing two or three families in each (smallish) room. This is precisely the kind of overcrowding the entire Modernist movement in architecture was set up to design out of urban settlement.&#xA;Further, barring the deployment of truly draconian powers of expropriation, central-zone land values in existing cities are in any event orders of magnitude too expensive to permit wholesale redevelopment at anything like the scale required. Entirely new cities will be necessary &#x2013; very likely, thousands of them.&#xA;The notorious Chinese predilection for ghost cities is being replicated on African terrain&#xA;It shouldn&#x2019;t surprise us that the planet&#x2019;s newest cities are to be found in the places where its population is most rapidly urbanising: India, China and sub-Saharan Africa . Whether acquired by eminent domain, compulsory purchase order or outright expropriation, assembling meaningfully sized parcels of land in existing urban cores can be a messy, expensive and time-consuming process. The favoured strategy in all of these places is therefore to develop entirely new satellite cities on peripheral sites where land is cheap &#x2013; or barring that, to build upon land reclaimed from the ocean.&#xA;Vanessa Watson, an urban planning expert at the University of Cape Town, has written extensively about this dynamic as it plays out in Africa . In Watson&#x2019;s telling, a long litany of private-sector new city initiatives now spangles the African continent, from the planned Nairobi developments of Konza Techno City and Tatu City, to Ghana&#x2019;s Appolonia and Hope City, to the Eko Atlantic project in Lagos (&#x201c;the best prime real estate in West Africa&#x201d;). Each represents an effort to gussy up the raw economics of land development with the comforting, familiar tropes of the knowledge economy. Each is dashed with the most superficial gloss of technological contemporaneity, right down to the inevitable &#x201c;Silicon&#x201d; prefix. And each is more placeless than the last, predicated on a generic model of development that could not possibly have less to do with the actual political, economic or material conditions obtaining in any African society .&#xA;"/>

Very soon we will have a light rail system.&#x2019;&#x201d;&lt;/p> &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/27/cycling-tel-aviv-israel&quot;>Continue reading...&lt;/a>" content="Pinterest&#xA;Sweat factor: a child cycles during a heat-wave in Tel Aviv. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP&#xA;One such learning moment was the renovation of Ibn Gabirol Street in 2010, the city&#x2019;s most important artery, connecting the northern Yarkon Park to the southern part of town. The road was narrowed to make space for bikes. But much to the chagrin of the Israel Bicycle Association, no separate bike paths were created. The pavement was simply broadened with dark paving indicating the rather narrow strip allotted to cyclists.&#xA;&#x201c;We had a big row with the council about it, but we failed to convince them to do it differently,&#x201d; Avizohar remembers. &#x201c;But nowadays everybody recognises that this was a mistake.&#x201d;&#xA;The situation in Ibn Gabirol Street has led to fights and accidents between pedestrians and cyclists. In 2014, a 68-year-old woman was hit by a bike when she got off a bus right next to a cycle lane. She hurt her shinbone and is now suing the city of Tel Aviv , arguing that the council encourages the development of a cycling culture, but fails to protect people who simply adhere to the traffic rules.&#xA;When it comes to cycle paths, Tel Aviv is learning from its mistakes. In 2012, separate bicycle paths at street level were built in Bloch Street, but it was by no means an easy task. Angry residents fiercely protested because some 50 parking places were sacrificed in the process. &#x201c;This is Israel: in the weekend we don&#x2019;t have public transport,&#x201d; explains Guido Segal. &#x201c;People said we need our cars and we need to be able to park them, but the mayor went ahead with the plan in spite of the protests. I think he was very brave.&#x201d;&#xA;Related: How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world&#xA;Although Tel Aviv is well on its way to developing a serious cycling culture, there are still many problems to tackle. One is the growing use of electric bikes &#x2013; including illegal ones that go as fast as 25 miles per hour &#x2013; that poses a serious threat to pedestrians. Another is the lack of connectivity. &#x201c;When streets are renovated, bike lanes do get built, but they do not always connect to other bike lanes. We don&#x2019;t have a continuous network making it easy to get from A to B,&#x201d; says Avizohar.&#xA;Many Tel Avivians still refrain from cycling because of the danger posed by unaware motorists and the shortage of good parking places. And then there is what Avizohar describes as &#x201c;the sweat factor&#x201d;: the scorching heat during the endless Tel Aviv summer. &#x201c;Showers in workplaces really are vital if we want the number of cyclists to go up,&#x201d; he says.&#xA;Showers in workplaces are, along with more bicycle infrastructure and bike parking places, among the measures in the Bike bill, devised to encourage cycling in the country. This bill has been under discussion since 2008 but has so far failed to pass. &#x201c;Some Israeli politicians still need to be convinced that the bike is not the problem but the solution,&#x201d; says Avizohar. He is, however, hopeful that the bill will this year pass its final reading in the Knesset.&#xA;&#x201c;We still have a lot of work to do,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;But we are optimists.&#x201d;&#xA;Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion&#xA;"/>

This trash-strewn urban ruin is tucked into the corner of a large parking lot within sight of the neon marquees of the Broadway theatre district. It is what remains of Taco House, one of LA&#x2019;s iconic hamburger stands, which are quickly being erased from this rapidly transforming city.&#xA;Los Angeles is, of course, inextricably associated with the automobile, and it was here that many suburban building types &#x2013; from modernist homes to fast-food restaurants &#x2013; were pioneered. But it is changing: five transit lines are being built, and cranes loom over the city&#x2019;s boulevards. The epicentre of this transition is the once moribund downtown, where a denser and wealthier city is displacing, among other things, one of its old, car-oriented icons.&#xA;The hamburger stand is part of southern California&#x2019;s rich tradition of roadside architecture. These buildings are typically 100 square-foot boxes, with an outdoor window to order and pick up food. Next to the structures are rudimentary dining areas, often consisting of no more than a plastic tarp and a few fold-up chairs and tables. To compensate for their diminutive size, the stands sometimes have large signs and, in more elaborate cases, are decorated to resemble everything from a log cabin to a traditional Korean house.&#xA;Perhaps the sprawling, car-obsessed Los Angeles of the post-war era was simply an aberration&#xA;LA&#x2019;s hamburger stands have held the fascination of visiting critics since the 1970s. Architects Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi famously coined the terms &#x201c;ducks&#x201d; and &#x201c;decorated sheds&#x201d; to describe buildings such as these, that use signage or elaborate decoration to signify their purpose. Reyner Banham, in his seminal book Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies, wrote rapturously about hamburgers as being &#x201c;a work of visual art&#x201d; and a &#x201c;fantasia on functional themes&#x201d;, comparable to the buildings in which they are sold.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Built in 1931, this faux-log cabin is the oldest hamburger stand in downtown LA. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock&#xA;The rise of the hamburger stand coincided with the decline of downtown Los Angeles. In the early part of the 20th century, it was the dominant centre of southern California, accounting for 90% of all retail sales. The hulking beaux arts buildings that line streets such as Spring and Broadway are a testament to downtown&#x2019;s former commercial might.&#xA;However, as early as the 1920s, the car began to decentralise the city, and the need for parking subsumed downtown. Hundreds of buildings were levelled to accommodate parking lots, such as the Armory Building, which once occupied the site of Taco House. This imposing, Romanesque revival edifice , which for a time housed the city&#x2019;s main post office, was levelled in 1938 and replaced by 800 sq ft of asphalt and a tiny stand.&#xA;There are approximately 20 hamburger stands left in downtown Los Angeles. They began to appear in the early 1930s, rapidly proliferated throughout the 40s and 50s, and the last was built in 1964. Only a fraction still serve food; others have been converted or stand vacant.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Illustration: Max Podemski&#xA;As white collar industries moved out of downtown in the mid-century, they were replaced by blue collar wholesalers. Responding to the new demographic brought in by these industries, kebabs, bibimbab and tortas joined hamburgers on the menus of many stands.&#xA;Ye Old Taco House has occupied the corner of a large parking lot at 4th and Hill Street since 1962. Like many of the stands, it is an immigrant-owned enterprise run by Maria Morales and her son Josh. On a slow Tuesday night, Maria helps in the kitchen as an older relative sits in the corner, watching TV. The Morales have operated the restaurant for 11 years, while the neighbourhood has transformed around them.&#xA;&#x201c;Before it was only Hispanic people, now it&#x2019;s everything: American people, Chinese people,&#x201d; Maria explains. As we speak, two security guards walk in, ordering in Spanish, followed by a tattooed rocker, most likely in the area for one of the new trendy bars that have opened up nearby.&#xA;Downtown is the centre of one of the most diverse cities on the planet, and the eclectic menus of many of the stands cater to an array of palates. The menu at Kiku Teriyaki includes all the standard teriyaki dishes as well as a large assortment of Korean ones, ranging from spicy squid and kimchi stew to mackerel pike with kimchi. &#x201c;All the restaurants on this street are owned by Koreans but I am the only one serving Korean food. They all eat here,&#x201d; says its owner, Mr Lee. &#x201c;Non-Koreans usually order teriyaki, but Mexicans and Armenians order Korean dishes because they like spicy food.&#x201d;&#xA;Further south, Maya Heidary is preparing her stand for its grand opening. Built in 1931, Maya&#x2019;s (as it is now known) is the oldest hamburger stand in downtown LA, and its log cabin facade and frying pan clock have changed little over the decades. Heidary is the fourth owner in the last year, and is having difficulty figuring out how to position her new restaurant in the changing neighbourhood.&#xA;&#x201c;There are all kinds of customers here: high class, middle class,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It makes it very hard to plan my menu, because if the price is too low you won&#x2019;t get the high class people, and if it&#x2019;s too high you won&#x2019;t get the middle class people. That is why many of the stands around here serve all kinds of food.&#x201d; Her stand has traditionally served Mexican food, and she plans to keep burritos and tacos on the menu while gradually expanding into hamburgers, pizzas and wraps.&#xA;With downtown LA now boasting a residential population that has grown to over 50,000, many stands have benefited. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s busy all the time now: lunchtime, in the evenings,&#x201d; says Maria Morales.&#xA;But these affluent new residents are not the traditional patrons of hamburger stands, and many have had to adapt. The Husky Boy stand on Broadway and 8th served office workers for decades with an &#x201c;only in LA&#x201d; menu of burritos, tacos and pastrami (a legacy of the Jewish and Mexican residents of Boyle Heights , east of downtown). In 2012, its mishmash façade was cleaned up and painted over with a colourful mural when it was taken over by Two Boots Pizza, a New York franchise with unorthodox pizzas with ingredients like creole chicken and jalapeño pesto.&#xA;"/>

Once the tamarind tree is cut down, you have no idea where the land boundary is. It was a very complex process.&#x201d;&#xA;To date, the state government has successfully managed to pool together 33,000 of the required 35,000 acres of land for the new capital. Difficulties remain, with farmers in more urban and fertile areas refusing to pool their land as the compensation offered by government is regarded as much less than the prevailing land value.&#xA;Balaji Reddy, a resident of Undavalli village in the capital region, is one of several thousand farmers who have petitioned the Andhra Pradesh High Court against land pooling, demanding that they be compensated fairly for their land.&#xA;Related: 'We don't need IT here': the inside story of India&#x2019;s smart city gold rush&#xA;&#x201c;All the villages here are rich, fertile, multi-crop lands,&#x201d; said Reddy, a tenant farmer cultivating five acres of banana, roses and jasmine. &#x201c;Our land is worth over 100 million rupees per acre now. We will get less than one-hundredth that rate from the government if we give up our lands for pooling. Why should we be losers?&#x201d;&#xA;His neighbour Srinivas Reddy (no relation), a farmer owning half an acre of farmland and cultivating three acres of lily, onion and roses on lease, agrees. &#x201c;We are earning more than enough to sustain our families now. We cannot afford to put our children through college if we take the government&#x2019;s offer. In the rural areas, the price of land is only 1 million rupees per acre, so it is lucrative for them to pool the land. That is not the case with us.&#x201d;&#xA;The state government of Andhra Pradesh has its work cut out, battling irate farmers in court on one hand, and dealing with bureaucratic tangles on the other.

Ankara&#x2019;s signature street delight is traditionally made by wrapping lamb intestines around available offal such as heart, sweetbread and lungs. It&#x2019;s seasoned with ginger, cumin, chilli and other spices and is roasted slowly over coals.&#xA;Around 10 years ago, there were talks of kokoreç being banned due to EU food regulations &#x2013; in case Turkey eventually became an EU member. But kokoreç fans weren&#x2019;t happy. Mirkelam, a pop singer, even composed a song dedicated to kokoreç . &#x201c;No kokoreç, never without you &#x2026; &#x201d;&#xA;Everyone&#x2019;s tuning into &#x2026;&#xA;Radyo ODTÜ was initiated by a group of students at the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ) in the mid-90s. It has quickly become an indispensable Ankara voice &#x2013; like a friend who has eyes and ears everywhere, and is great at discovering the best gigs. It&#x2019;s also known as a companion for students pulling all-nighters before their notoriously difficult final exams.&#xA;Although Radyo ODTÜ is now a private media company, it&#x2019;s still affiliated with the radio society at the university, where students are trained to be broadcasters; it&#x2019;s now one of the most popular radio stations in Turkey .&#xA;Best venue&#xA;Launched in 2010, CerModern was the answer to the prayers of many art lovers in Ankara, who wanted to see world-class modern art exhibitions on a more regular basis. With a 4,500 sq metre exhibition hall, CerModern is currently Turkey&#x2019;s largest modern art centre. It also hosts flamenco concerts, literature workshops and Iranian new wave cinema.&#xA;Who&#x2019;s top of the playlist?&#xA;Pilli Bebek might have been around since 1993, but it&#x2019;s only been in the last few years that their loyal fan-base has really grown, as the band produced the soundtrack for the phenomenal TV series, Behzat Ç. An Ankara Detective Story .&#xA;Although Pilli Bebek&#x2019;s music can broadly be defined as alternative Anatolian rock, their style is also influenced by barcarole, Ottoman classical music, heavy metal and Latin music.&#xA;Deeply romantic and possessing a bittersweet melancholy, their music captures the spirit of Ankara in a way no other band has managed. Listening to it is like enjoying the warmth of roasted chestnuts bought from a street seller on a cold winter&#x2019;s night in the city.&#xA;Best local artist&#xA;Nuri Abaç is one of the most important artists to come from Ankara. Although he passed away in 2008, his paintings are still among the most sought-after in the city&#x2019;s galleries.&#xA;He painted the street sellers, fishermen, pubs, kebab shops and tea gardens, blending the everyday with surreal elements of Anatolian folklore and mythology.&#xA;Abaç was also one of the pioneers of art appreciation in Ankara. When Abaç opened his first exhibition here in the 1960s, there were no art galleries so he had to exhibit in a hotel lobby. More than five decades later, Ankara is home to dozens of galleries and has a thriving local art scene.&#xA;What&#x2019;s the look on the street?&#xA;In a city that has a varied climate with pronounced temperature differences between day and night, dressing appropriately is a fine art. A coat and good boots are key in winter, as the temperature regularly gets down to around -15C. In fact, unless it&#x2019;s summer, it&#x2019;s generally a good idea to have a coat on you at all times &#x2013; while it can get quite warm during the days, the moment sun goes down Ankara can feel like a city in the polar circle. Hence people dress like onions, layering their clothes to avoid the chill.&#xA;Best cultural Instagram account&#xA;Ankara&#x2019;nin Bug&#x2019;lari literally means &#x201c;Bugs of Ankara&#x201d; in Turkish &#x2013; this satirical account features the absurdities, or &#x201c;bugs&#x201d;, of the city&#x2019;s urban design, from this dinosaur statue to Ankara&#x2019;s &#x201c; stairways to heaven &#x201d; and many other urban epic-fails. It sprouted from a Facebook page of the same name.&#xA;Melih Gökçek, Ankara&#x2019;s mayor since 1994, is responsible for many of these bugs &#x2013; he always has a project on the go, earning him the nickname &#x201c;a surrealist in Ankara&#x201d; .&#xA;What&#x2019;s the big talking point?&#xA;Although it happened more than three months ago, the grief caused by the killing of 102 citizens at a peace rally on 10 October 2015 isn&#x2019;t going anywhere &#x2013; it was the deadliest such attack in Turkish history .&#xA;This bombing robbed a piece of our soul forever. It was a rude awakening for many urban middle-class Turks like myself. Prior to the attacks, it didn&#x2019;t really occur to us that we could be killed by the dozens, in our hometown and in broad daylight &#x2013; we were conditioned to believe that it was always &#x201c;someone else&#x201d; who had to die. But now we know, and we&#x2019;ll never unlearn it.&#xA;Comedy gold&#xA;Çinçin, one of Ankara&#x2019;s most impoverished neighbourhoods, might not look like prime comedy material, but when the residents of a slum community have their houses demolished and are forced to move into tower blocks, sometimes black humour is the only way to deal with things.&#xA;YouTube series Yolunda A.&#x15e;. features three friends from Çinçin navigating the changes in their communities. It became an instant hit.&#xA;After its success as a series, the Yolunda A.&#x15e;. team launched a feature-length movie in May 2015 . In it the main characters are trying to save their community from mass property development schemes and exploitation. Both the series and the movie were produced in close collaboration with the Çinçin residents &#x2013; many of the producers and actors are from the neighbourhood.&#xA;What does Ankara do better than anywhere else?&#xA;Our city is a fusion of Anatolian cultures. Since it became the capital in the 1920s, the population has soared from 75,000 to over five million. Rapid developments, including the ongoing migration from rural areas, have fostered a uniquely Anatolian modernity. The city is modern without being snobby, and is unembarrassed of its provincial origins &#x2013; many residents of Ankara, including this writer, still have a village somewhere and maintain ties with their rural roots.&#xA;You can see these roots in the culture: whilst there are lively rock, metal and trance music scenes, during weddings many people dance to &#x201c;Ankara Havasi&#x201d;, a style of central Anatolian psychedelic folk music with very absurd lyrics. The historic opera and ballet hall might be booked out for every single event, but there&#x2019;s a very good chance those who appreciate Hamlet will also devour their kokoreç with bitter turnip juice after the show at a street stall.&#xA;Moment in history&#xA;There were few Turkish musicians who were as loved as Bar&#x131;&#x15f; Manço &#x2013; a rock legend and one of the pioneers of Anatolian rock. Blending the melodies of Anatolian folk music with 70s psychedelic sounds, and adding a dash of social critique, Bar&#x131;&#x15f; Manço&#x2019;s 1985 concert in Ankara is cherished.&#xA;Best street art&#xA;Dubbed as the &#x201c;Banksy&#x2019;s of Ankara&#x201d;, KÜF Project are a group of guerrilla artists who criticise the top-down urban development projects and their lack of aesthetics.

As ever we&#x2019;d love to hear about your favourite stories too &#x2013; share them in the comments below.&#xA;Copenhagen&#x2019;s floodable parks&#xA;When rain falls in most of our concrete-lined cities (I&#x2019;m looking at you today, London), at best we are left with a soggy urban landscape, dotted with flooded patches and the occasional impromptu stream. But what if we could design rainfall into our public spaces? What if sports pitches, for example, could be transformed into picturesque ponds when it rains?&#xA;Well, that&#x2019;s the plan for Copenhagen&#x2019;s large urban park, Enghaveparken &#x2013; where water is being put at the heart of its redesign. &#x201c;Water storage will be provided by excavating below-grade zones where sports such as football and hockey can be played when the park is dry, but where water can fill up into retention ponds when it rains,&#x201d; writes Athlyn Cathcart-Keays in Citiscope . The park boundary will also be marked by a dyke which will filter water around the grounds and into 100 small community gardens.&#xA;It&#x2019;s part of a city-wide plan to create &#x201c;climate-resilient neighbourhoods&#x201d; in anticipation of more rainfall. Rotterdam, a city often affected by flooding, has been doing something similar with its Benthemplein water square , where three concrete basins normally used for leisure activities are transformed into water basins during heavy rainfalls to relieve the city&#x2019;s sewage system.&#xA;Cities in the UK, too, are exploring various ways that urban landscapes can be more flood resilient. But I don&#x2019;t think our sports courts and public spaces are turning into ponds just yet &#x2013; at least, not deliberately.&#xA;The perils of cabin porn&#xA;Last week we had a special focus on gentrification , exploring how the phenomenon is changing cities around the world. But are cities the only places impacted? Apparently not: Pop-Up City considers the gentrification of forests and woodlands , as trends like &#x201c;cabin porn&#x201d; and technology fatigue lead the urban creative elite to seek a renewed connection with nature.&#xA;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no surprise that the recent cabin trend started in the American tech community as a reaction to the increasing digitalization of our lifestyles,&#x201d; writes Joop de Boer. &#x201c;People that are most into it seem to be the first to get exhausted by fast urban dynamics.&#x201d;&#xA;As well as the desire for a beautiful home in the woods, companies are locating their offices in the wilderness too &#x2013; some in the form of mobile co-working trailers complete with solar panels and Wi-Fi. Woodland gentrification may not have the repercussions as seen in cities &#x2013; displaced populations, the loss of affordable housing &#x2013; but conservation specialists may soon be worried to see their forests populated by creatures of a different nature. Is nowhere safe from the monied hipster?&#xA;"/>

In a speech to British parliamentarians in 2005, Andrew Natsios, the head of USAid at the time, explicitly rejected what he described as the &#x201c;European&#x201d; approach:&#xA;The European debate addresses the development challenge largely devoid of foreign policy or national security considerations &#x2026; &#x2018;Pure&#x2019; development &#x2013; that is, development abstracted from foreign policy concerns in the real world and the challenges it presents &#x2013; is not likely sustainable over the long term I fear.&#xA;In the cold war, the dynamics of a bipolar world and competition with the Soviet Union required us to guard and expand our alliance systems. Diplomatically, this meant friendship with some unsavoury leaders and regimes.&#xA;Our foreign assistance programming reflected these same imperatives. It was built around stability, not transformative development.&#xA;Today this has changed &#x2026; We are now menaced more by &#x2018;fragile states than by conquering states&#x2019;, as President Bush&#x2019;s national security strategy of 2002 declares &#x2026; Opening the developing world to economic opportunity and expanding the ranks of democratic states are now central to our own national security.&#xA;Natsios&#x2019;s prediction finally appears to have come about. The David Cameron government in the UK has caught up with what Natsios called the Bush doctrine.&#xA;Related: The aid pie is growing, but the poorest countries get a smaller slice | Adrian Lovett&#xA;While it worries many, this is entirely understandable &#x2013; and probably sensible. Now that aid is 0.7% of gross national income , at a time when other departments are battening down the hatches, the government needs to defend aid spending like never before to a sometimes sceptical media and public.&#xA;The creation of the Department for International Development (DfID) by the Labour government in 1997 was a masterstroke. It was an important moment in the history of international development in this country precisely because it gave the UK a powerhouse of poverty-focused spending. But even then, the language of national interest was never far from Tony Blair&#x2019;s lips.&#xA;The question is not whether aid and the national interest are related, but how.&#xA;An obvious example of a shift towards aid spending in the national interest is a promise in the new strategy to ramp up spending in fragile states , presumably with a view to responding to increased volatility and security threats. Some commentators are worried that this might mean a reduction in aid going to stable countries.&#xA;It would be very surprising if DfID allowed itself to fall into that bear trap, given its hugely expanded aid budget, large-scale commitments in longstanding recipient countries, and commitment to achieving results for the poorest (which is a lot easier in stable situations than conflict).&#xA;The lessons of Sierra Leone and Liberia in relation to the Ebola outbreak , and of Mali with its unexpected civil uprising , are clear: focusing on systems in apparently stable countries is crucial in helping to keep them clear of crisis, be it conflict, disease or climate-related.&#xA;The important thing for DfID is to ensure its aid allocation decisions are negotiated with other major donors so that we don&#x2019;t end up with a large amount of so-called &#x201c;aid orphans&#x201d;: countries that receive far less than they should given their poverty levels. Donors also need to guard against flooding countries with aid. Throwing money around is often not the answer in complex development situations, and can do more harm than good, especially when uncoordinated.&#xA;Perhaps an even clearer symbol of the realignment between development and national interest is the decision to increase substantially the share of aid spent by government departments other than DfID . This is both an opportunity and risk.&#xA;There is a great line in the strategy that says: &#x201c;We want to meet our promises to the world&#x2019;s poor and also put international development at the heart of our national security and foreign policy.&#x201d;&#xA;The opportunity here is a step towards more policy coherence across government, so that anti-poverty considerations are at the heart of trade negotiations, business investments, international environmental summits, and military spending, with development and poverty experts invited into all the relevant Whitehall departments to advise.&#xA;The risk is the flipside of that: national security and foreign policy at the heart of international development.&#xA;It will be hard to get the balance right. Aid spending is difficult to get right at the best of times, simply in terms of effectiveness and value for money. Adding more complex motives and incentives to the mix won&#x2019;t make it any easier.&#xA;Civil society now has a platform on which to campaign for policy coherence, but also needs to keep a very watchful eye on how things evolve.&#xA;One final thought. Polling evidence suggests the public is still largely charitable towards much poorer countries, and is more likely to support aid for poverty reduction. So while the language of national interest may excite some wings of the Tory party and the media, demonstrating that aid has been effective is the name of the game when it comes to winning over the public.&#xA;"/>

Like Nat Nat Nwe, he is now working as an advocate and speaks of the useful practical skills he has learned, but he also says the programme improved his self-esteem.&#xA;Chan Chan feels that the impact of discrimination is compounded by poverty. &#x201c;For example, some of my friends are not educated so they do harsh labour. Their daily wage is really low. For a male worker, say 30,00 kyat [about £16.30] &#x2013; for a female worker who does a light job, half that. Transgender men have to do the same job as male workers, but they get the salary that women are paid. Whenever they complain the boss says, &#x2018;You are biologically female. If you don&#x2019;t like it, quit.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#xA;A key part of the training, Hla Myat Tun explained, is simply making LGBT people aware of their legal and human rights.&#xA;To an extent, Myanmar has been suspended in time, with all discussion of rights and equality inhibited by the authoritarian junta government who ruled the country until recently . A dense tangle of archaic, discriminatory laws left behind by the British hasn&#x2019;t helped. But things are changing, slowly.&#xA;&#x201c;Since the country has opened up, people have started talking about LGBT rights . But the general society still needs to become aware,&#x201d; said Hla Myat Tun. &#x201c;Many people misunderstand LGBT communities as asking for special rights, but we are just asking for equal rights as human beings.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

Given that its prewar population was just over 4 million, this is an overwhelming burden, one with which any government would struggle to cope.&#xA;Related: Syrian refugee children work Beirut streets to support families&#xA;Syrian refugees in Lebanon are highly vulnerable to exploitation. Most have little or no money, yet they have to pay landlords for the patches of land on which they erect their tents, and to supplement the meagre aid handouts they may be fortunate enough to receive. But the Lebanese government &#x2013; keen to stop Syrians settling permanently in Lebanon &#x2013; is preventing refugees from working or even residing legally in the country. It is refusing to issue work permits except in exceptional circumstances. And it is now very difficult for Syrians to obtain residency permits &#x2013; a key obstacle being a $200 (£140) annual fee per adult refugee &#x2013; meaning most are breaking the law simply by staying in the country (pdf).&#xA;This creates conditions ripe for abusive employers to exploit vulnerable refugees. Because they don&#x2019;t have the necessary papers, refugees live in fear of coming into contact with the authorities, particularly at the many checkpoints throughout the country. As children are less likely to be stopped at checkpoints, they are forced to work in the fields or in nearby towns. Unscrupulous employers prefer them because they are more compliant, and more unwilling to complain about physical abuse. For this laborious and often hazardous work, they are paid a few dollars at most, a portion of which is often retained by the Syrian settlement leader.&#xA;"/>

These shanty towns are often in locations highly susceptible to the effects of extreme climate events.&#xA;My name is Kary Stewart and this month I visit Chosica, on the outskirts of Lima, and Piura, in the north of the country, to find out more about how the residents are dealing with the consequences of El Niño.&#xA;WZ My name is William Zegarra and I work for the NGO Practical Action here in Chosica. Now we are in the area of San Fernando. This is the Rímac river, our famous Rímac river.&#xA;KS We&#x2019;re in San Fernando in the district of Chosica on the outskirts of Lima province, a about an hour from the capital&#x2019;s centre. The poorer inhabitants live in the valley along the river Rímac and on the mountainside, and sometimes in the creeks themselves, mostly in basic structures built from brick and scrap material. When the heavy rains come every year in around March the area becomes susceptible to both landslides, which plummet down from the creeks in the mountains, and also to floods from the river bursting its banks.&#xA;WZ In 1987-88 we had El Niño and there was a lot of damage and victims because people hadn&#x2019;t experienced landslides before and there hadn&#x2019;t been any type of preparation. The whole risk management and civil defence system was very basic, practically non-existent in this area. Since then we have had the landslides every two or three years.&#xA;Related: Bitter winters for Peru's alpaca farmers combating climate change | Sam Jones&#xA;GP My name is Gabriela Perez. I am 16 years old and I live in Chosica on the outskirts of Lima. Where I live in Rayos del Sol there was a landslide last year. It come down through the mountain gorge where we least expected it, because seven years ago there was a landslide that came down from another part of the mountain and that&#x2019;s where we expected it. The lady that collects recyclable goods lived in the path of the landslide. She wasn&#x2019;t home but her daughter was there with her baby and her brother. That was the first family that suffered the effects of the landslide; and, unfortunately, many families lost their lives apart from them.&#xA;KS Manuel Pulgar-Vidal is the minister of the environment for Peru. He&#x2019;s not so sure that El Niño was responsible for last year&#x2019;s landslide, in which nine people lost their lives and six others went missing.&#xA;MP-V Nobody knows exactly if it were a problem with El Niño or some kind of winds with rain and clouds that came from the southern Antarctic part of the continent. Unfortunately poor people used to set their houses in those creeks, in the most vulnerable creeks. I think that we still have not really understood the risk that we are assuming when we put our house in that place.&#xA;KS Piura is in the Cajamarca region in the far north of the country, and is set on desert scrub land. The shanty towns around the river Piura and beyond are highly vulnerable to the effects of flooding caused by heavy rains. Felix Zapata from NGO Practical Action works with the local community to help prepare them for the effects of El Niño.&#xA;FZ We have been working in three districts and in four communities. In the district of the 26 de Octubre we are working in Los Polvorines which is also an area that when the water level of the river rises it&#x2019;s a lost area; and also in two other shanty towns. So the work that we have done in this area is [to] set up an irrigation route, making it wider and we have also built a retaining wall and have widened the entrance [so] the doctors, ambulances and the first response teams have easy access, and also so people can evacuate.&#xA;JN My name is Jenny Nesama. I also work for Practical Action in Piura. Los Polvorines is a shanty town that has been there for about 15 years and is growing. This is one of the most critical locations because it has been built on what used to be a lake, which means the soil isn&#x2019;t the most sturdy. It is also where the natural drainage system used to run which used to offload the rainwater until it was invaded 15 years ago and now the people don&#x2019;t want to leave.&#xA;KS Invasiones or invasions is a term used to describe the act of illegally settling on a piece of land. Typically most invasions are on land that has no clear owner, often because of its precarious location &#x2013; such as near rivers, drainage systems or mountains which make them vulnerable to extreme conditions such as those caused by El Niño.&#xA;JN We have been working on prevention techniques with the people. If they are prepared this might at least save lives in the event of strong rains. We know that as an NGO it is not our responsibility to get them to leave the land; that is the municipality&#x2019;s responsibility and also a much more complicated issue.&#xA;KS The district known as 26 de Octubre is an area settled through invasions and is currently in the process of becoming recognised as a formal town. Ana Chandovisi Esquen is president of the local organisation that looks after the residents&#x2019; rights. And she&#x2019;s a well-known figurehead in the local area. I went to meet her at her home deep within the slums.&#xA;ACE I&#x2019;ve been here for seven years. Others have been here for 11 years. There are around 700 plots; around 1,500 families multiplied by three or four would give you the inhabitants although some families are bigger. Life is a bit difficult here. There was one time when they wanted to evict us and that&#x2019;s why they came to do a census as a trick. But as a leader we know how a census works and nobody can come and cheat us.&#xA;KS The cluster of villages where Ana lives huddle around a drain that comes from the city of Piura. The rainwater drain is called Victor Maldonado. It deposits its waters into the Santa Julia lake and eventually into the sea.&#xA;EAG My name is Eduardo Angulo Gonzalez. I&#x2019;m the head of the department of the regional office for security and national defence. Our houses are located in low areas. In order to raise their homes to above flooding level they pile up the soil with construction material and say: &#x201c;There, I&#x2019;ve piled it up to the necessary height.&#x201d; But when there are floods this material gets soaked anyway and [water] gets to the foundation of the houses which are made with the basic materials. The result is that the houses crumble. All these families are going to have problems when it rains. What they have to do is leave.&#xA;The humidity level of the soil there is very high, which isn&#x2019;t good for the health of the children. All these people here are going to suffer with floods. The problem is that people are used to living close to the city, so if you offered them a safe plot two, three, 10 kilometres away, they don&#x2019;t want to go there.&#xA;ACE We&#x2019;re right next to the Los Patos lake. We can see a lot of contamination &#x2013; building material. We&#x2019;re in a shanty town, Armando Villanuevo del Campo, with a representative, Mr Leiter.&#xA;ML Of course, right now El Niño hasn&#x2019;t happened but there is a possibility it could happen in March. And you can see that this part would be most affected. If this lake fills up the water will come this way and could bring disease. It should not be stagnant, it should run freely.&#xA;KS Back in Lima I asked Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the minister of the environment, why he thought people made their homes in these areas, despite knowing the risks.&#xA;Related: Peru harnesses ancient canal system to tackle Lima water shortage | Dan Collyns&#xA;MP-V This social phenomenon of invasion &#x2013; it is related first to poor people who migrate mostly from the Andean part of the country, that is where the poorest people live. The cost of the land it is quite expensive for them so they are used to seeking outside the urban area or the main part of the urban area. Most of the time they are seeking to invade areas in which there are some probably lack of information [about] the owner, because if there is an owner obviously that owner is going to defend their land. So that is why they are used to going to the hills or close to the river, to the basin, and unfortunately [they] are the risk areas of our geography.&#xA;You know that when you are in poor conditions because of your economy, because of your way of life &#x2013; that unfortunately your vision is a short-term vision. So that is why the people quickly forget the last El Niño and forget the risks because they need to have some place. They need to continue their activities, so that is why it is very difficult.&#xA;It is like, for example, the illegal mining. The people know that they are polluting the rivers and they are also creating a pollution problem with mercury. Yes, they know. But they think that probably in the future when they are with better life conditions they can deal with that. So it is a balance that is a trade-off. Now we need to have a house, economic activity &#x2026; I know that there are some risks but they are used to assuming that risk. And that is sad because they know that they can suffer really bad consequences and [are] putting at risk their own life.&#xA;KS So in terms of the government, whose responsibility is all this?&#xA;MP-V You know that it is related to the land and to that kind of settlement. It is not related to the national government but to local government. So the local government needs to be more strong to have forbidden areas because they need to protect their own population. I think that one of the problems of Piura is that there are a lot of economic activities but based in an informal system. So that is why it is very difficult to adopt or to have a standard procedure to deal with the consequences of El Niño. You should go settlement by settlement to try and identify what kind of consequences they could have.&#xA;KS In Piura as in many vulnerable shanty districts the residents have become very proactive organising their own risk prevention techniques and learning about their rights.&#xA;JRP My name is Johans Rodriguez Purisaca. I&#x2019;m 31 years old. I&#x2019;m accompanied by my wife, Analia Inga Pedrera. We are members of the first brigade of the Polvorines; the first trained and certified brigade from the new district of 26 de Octubre in the shanty town of Polvorines. In May we started to form the civil defence platform. Everyone really persevered with the training. We did it with a lot of dedication and love. We have a certificate through the ministry of education and accredited by the district of 26 de Octubre that has recognised us as the first brigade of the district. They now count on us as the first response brigadiers for any emergency.&#xA;KS And then there is the work of the regional defence departments. Eduardo Angulo Gonzalez, the head of the regional office for security and national defence.&#xA;EAG This office has three lines of action: risk and disaster management; urban security; and national defence. You can see here on the whiteboard we are evaluating the sea temperature. We receive this information from the Peruvian Sea Institute . We also receive information from the Estudio Nacional del Fenómeno El Niño &#x2013; Enfen. Six months ago they expected El Niño to be strong with disastrous effects. So it now has been changed into moderate, which means it won&#x2019;t be a harmful event but it will rain.&#xA;KS The complex issues around illegal settlers are seemingly a long way from resolution. In the meantime, however, work continues to both manage risk and prevent disaster.&#xA;MP-V Even though we have received this good news that probably we are going to not have a strong El Niño, still we are working with a lot of money in preventive measures. The second measure is how we are going to manage an emergency. And the third part is to manage the rehabilitation in case we suffer the consequences, and a relocation, if it&#x2019;s needed.&#xA;Related: Peru's fog catchers net water supplies | Dan Collyns&#xA;KS The regional governor of Piura.&#xA;RH We work on risk prevention on three levels: the national government; the regional government, who I represent as the governor; and the local government. The rural area is the responsibility of the national government and the agriculture ministry. On a local level in the cities it&#x2019;s our job to clean the city drains which are the rain drains. We&#x2019;re working on this with the help of the mayors and the housing ministry.&#xA;KS Back in Chosica the local residents are not convinced that the risk prevention work that the local authorities are doing is enough. Ana Ninahuanca Gómez is the president of the local residents&#x2019; group.&#xA;ANG Concerning the contingency plan, the local government hasn&#x2019;t put anything forward. There have only been some minor training courses about that. So right now, the inhabitants themselves have their own contingency plan. If a landslide comes, they will go to higher areas for safety. We&#x2019;re waiting for the authorities, the local authorities as well as the Lima regional authorities, because they were supposed to work on the dykes, and so far they haven&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s only been the central government that has been putting the wire nets in, and getting money for the walls. We really don&#x2019;t know what will become of the most vulnerable people when the rains start in March. We&#x2019;re very worried.&#xA;We do feel a little more ready, because several organisations have come to prepare us on how to protect ourselves, in the event of a large landslide; what measures we could take. We would like more training for the communities, to know how to safeguard our lives, and those of our loved ones, and our neighbours and the elderly.&#xA;KS 16-year-old Gabriela Perez.&#xA;GP Apart from the fact that we learn how to raise awareness we are also learning that we have rights. The government could send us many things but you know there is a lot of bureaucracy, and essential goods don&#x2019;t get here. That&#x2019;s the reality for us. When they send supplies, they send beans and things like that. Can a six-month-old baby eat that? No. They have to eat baby food. In those moments all the shops close and the demand increases. We need to buy things but there&#x2019;s nowhere to buy them. These are the things that I have been talking about with my peers and I know that we have to defend our rights.&#xA;KS So is it possible to forecast an El Niño?&#xA;MP-V No, no &#x2013; who knows? You know that unfortunately the last statistics show that El Niño can appear every seven to 10 years. In the past it has been a larger time than current. So that is why we should be very, very aware that we can suffer continually that kind of effect.&#xA;KS In a country like Peru with so much institutional and cultural complexity, the work of trying to reduce the risk and protect the population from El Niño and other natural disasters is ongoing. Reynaldo Hilbert, the regional governor of Piura.&#xA;Related: Hunger threatens millions as El Niño causes drought and floods&#xA;RH What we&#x2019;re doing now is recovering from the 1998 El Niño. The cities, the countryside and the highways are just as vulnerable as they were in 1998. I believe that if we want to overcome this problem we have to carry out major infrastructure improvements. El Niño is no longer a phenomenon. A phenomenon is every 500 years; and the El Niño event happens often now. During the past 30 years two of them have been very strong but in between we&#x2019;ve had a lot of heavy rains. We now have to live with this event and we have to be prepared.&#xA;KS I&#x2019;m Kary Stewart and that&#x2019;s all for this month&#x2019;s Global development podcast.

The alliance, of which 40 African heads of state are members, plans to extend its tracking to examine progress at district and state levels.&#xA;Related: Mosquito-eating vampire spider could be recruited for war on malaria&#xA;Liberia, Rwanda and Senegal all achieved reductions in malaria incidence of up to 75% between 2011 and 2015. Phumaphi said Liberia&#x2019;s success was particularly impressive given the Ebola epidemic, which threatened to drain resources from other health programmes.&#xA;&#x201c;Sustaining all of the work around malaria prevention, in the midst of the Ebola crisis, was a tremendous challenge for Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone,&#x201d; Phumaphi said. &#x201c;There were also a lot of misdiagnosis cases &#x2013; people who presented with malaria were sometimes diagnosed with Ebola. Despite all of the challenges, and in the middle of such a brutal crisis, it is remarkable that countries continued to distribute bed nets and vector control programmes were aggressively applied. It could have been horrible, but instead Liberia managed to sustain the gains it had already made.&#x201d;&#xA;Phumaphi also praised countries including Zambia and Chad that had made impressive gains in reducing malaria because of domestic investment. &#x201c;There are many countries that may not have reached the MDG target but have still performed incredibly well; it&#x2019;s just that they had different starting points,&#x201d; she said.&#xA;The sustainable development goals (SDGs), which replaced the MDGs this year, aim to achieve universal health coverage and end the malaria epidemic by 2030. Among the obstacles are the dual threats of insecticide and drug resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, mosquito resistance to insecticides is increasing, and, in south-east Asia, resistance to artemisinin , the most common drug used to treat malaria, is a significant threat.&#xA;Related: World Health Organisation right to be wary about first malaria vaccine | Seth Berkley and Mark Dybul&#xA;&#x201c;While we know what actions work to prevent malaria, we need more innovation in how to overcome drug and insecticide resistance &#x2013; new treatments, new regimes, new vector-control approaches. And ultimately, we need a vaccine,&#x201d; Phumaphi said.&#xA;Despite the challenges, Phumaphi said malaria prevention had the potential to create savings that could be spent on fighting other health inequalities.&#xA;&#x201c;WHO have demonstrated that prevention efforts have saved an estimated $900m [$630m] in case management costs between 2001 and 2004, and that&#x2019;s direct costs. Some economists have shown we can save up to $34bn a year in direct and indirect costs by eradicating malaria. That could be a massive contribution to other SDGs and ensure we succeed in other areas too.&#x201d;&#xA;This article was corrected on 1 February 2016 to remove the suggestion that malaria is a virus.&#xA;"/>

I am really working on this.&#x201d;&#xA;Mayan Awak, the community engagement officer who led the discussions, says men beat their wives as a show of masculinity. &#x201c;Since I was six years old I was taught this is how it is, so I couldn&#x2019;t just say, &#x2018;This is wrong. Stop it&#x2019;. Instead we asked people to talk openly &#x2013; whether they are a chief or a housewife. I asked them to say honestly, &#x2018;What are the things that pain you?&#x2019;&#xA;&#x201c;When we talked like this people saw that many of the problems they had were because of gender violence. For example, in our community, raids to steal cattle from another village are common and raping women is always a part of the raiding.

Like an increasing number of young women lured from garment factories on the promise of better work and brighter horizons in China, she ended up sold to a stranger and trapped in a life of abuse as one of Cambodia&#x2019;s trafficked brides.&#xA;After months of sexual assault and domestic servitude, Phany escaped. What she never expected was that when she returned to Cambodia she would be treated as an outcast, her life still plagued by the horrors she had lived through.&#xA;Every year, dozens of Cambodian women are trafficked to China and sold as brides. Although there is no official data available, one Cambodian human rights group, Adhoc, says it received 35 new cases last year. Foreign ministry spokesman Chum Sounry says that in 2015 the Cambodian government facilitated the return of 85 trafficked brides who had managed to reach a Cambodian consulate . Many others who are unaccounted for are thought to be trapped and unable to return home.&#xA;Related: A journey across four continents: Danziger's tales from Cambodia | Rory MacLean&#xA;&#x201c;You can be sure that for every woman who escapes her captivity in China and returns to Cambodia, there are dozens more that never make it out,&#x201d; says Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch&#x2019;s Asia division.&#xA;China&#x2019;s former one-child policy and the preference for male children created such skewed sex ratios that some families are unable to find local women for their sons to marry. Poor villages in Cambodia have been increasingly seen by traffickers as a source of potential brides.&#xA;They offer young women and their families &#x2013; whose employment options often range little further than working in garment factories &#x2013; decent work, better pay and more opportunities in China.&#xA;Phany, now 29, worked for six months as a poorly paid seamstress in a local factory. She decided to travel to China with her 20-year-old sister after her cousin introduced her to a Chinese couple who said they could offer her more lucrative factory work.&#xA;When they arrived in Shanghai they were met by a Cambodian man who said he was arranging work for them. The next day, the sisters were sold to two men who came to buy wives. One of the men paid cash for Phany and took her away, telling her that he was her new husband. They later registered their marriage, though Phany has never seen the documents.&#xA;Phany&#x2019;s life became a cycle of physical, sexual and mental abuse as she carried out chores under the watchful eye of her husband and his mother.&#xA;Unable to communicate through speech, her husband would rely on gestures to give orders, often becoming aggressive if they weren&#x2019;t obeyed.&#xA;&#x201c;Sometimes even if there wasn&#x2019;t any problem he&#x2019;d attack me,&#x201d; she says, as she mimicked her husband pulling at her hair and kicking her. She says she was frequently raped.&#xA;In her six months in China, Phany tried to escape three times. The third time her husband caught her, he hit her repeatedly in the stomach before finally letting her go.&#xA;Borrowing money from her parents, she returned to Cambodia. &#x201c;I felt so happy. It was like being born again,&#x201d; she says.&#xA;Yet when she returned to her community, she was treated as an outcast and blamed for the abuse that she&#x2019;d suffered. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t want to talk to me any more,&#x201d; she says, describing how her family had been torn apart by her experience.&#xA;Phany eventually left her village and went to work in Phnom Penh, where she says she can live a more anonymous life.&#xA;&#x201c;I used to not want to get to know anybody because I didn&#x2019;t want to admit what happened to me,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Whenever I go back to my village I feel so ashamed. If the people around me wouldn&#x2019;t look down on me I would want to move back home.&#x201d;&#xA;People who have been trafficked are legally entitled to support services but, with the government focusing on the prosecution of traffickers, this rarely materialises.&#xA;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a rule for the government to support victims who have returned but actually [there is] no support,&#x201d; says Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children&#x2019;s division at Adhoc, which last year helped more than a dozen trafficked women to return home.&#xA;"/>

The two first-term senators, long viewed as rising stars within the GOP, had been jockeying for weeks to claim the mantle of the party&#x2019;s alternative to Donald Trump.&#xA;Their biographical similarities, although superficial, are nonetheless striking: both rode a Tea Party wave to the US Senate &#x2013; Rubio in 2010 and Cruz in 2012 &#x2013; often drawing on the inspirational tale of their immigrant parents to underscore the promise of America. Both graduates of law and in their mid-40s, born only six months apart, they are also the youngest candidates in the race. And while their attacks on each other may call it into question, there is little in their record to indicate that Rubio and Cruz are anything but staunchly conservative.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Marco Rubio addresses his caucus-night event in Des Moines, Iowa. Photograph: Pete Marovich/Getty Images&#xA;However, the parallels end there. In their short tenure in elected office, Rubio and Cruz have played dramatically different roles both in Washington and the 2016 Republican primary.&#xA;Since arriving in the Senate in 2013, Cruz quickly earned the reputation of a rabble rouser. A conservative firebrand who boasts of &#x201c;taking on the Washington cartel&#x201d;, the Texan rose to national prominence by almost single-handedly leading the nation into its first government shutdown in 17 years. He infamously decried Mitch McConnell &#x2013; the leader of Senate Republicans &#x2013; as &#x201c;a liar&#x201d; in a stunning breach of congressional decorum.&#xA;Such tactics have made Cruz arguably the most unpopular senator in either party, a tag he has worn as an asset in an election fuelled by frustration with Washington. Needless to say, he has not been endorsed by any of his colleagues in the Senate &#x2013; securing instead the support of the House GOP&#x2019;s right wing.&#xA;In his quest for the Republican nomination, Cruz has united the party&#x2019;s evangelical and Tea Party wings and assembled support from a variety of influential figures on the right. This, combined with a strong grassroots campaign that makes extensive use of technology, has led to some comparisons of the Texas senator with another young first-term senator, Barack Obama.&#xA;The similarities with Obama go deeper. A fellow graduate of Harvard Law, Cruz clerked for supreme ourt chief justice William Rehnquist and argued a number of cases before the US supreme court as the solicitor general for the state of Texas.&#xA;And yet it is Rubio, 44, who has drawn the most comparisons to Obama: a young senator in a hurry and a dynamic speaker pitching an optimistic message calling for a new generation of leadership.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Marco Rubio, with his son Anthony, 10, will be hoping the Iowa result gives him a lift going into the next key primaries. Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP&#xA;He first ran for office at the age of 24, setting off one of the more rapid ascensions in national political ranks in recent memory. Elected to the Florida legislature in 1999, Rubio went on to become both the state&#x2019;s youngest and first Cuban American speaker of the House.&#xA;Rubio&#x2019;s unbridled ambition took him even further in 2010, as he launched a long-shot bid for Florida&#x2019;s Senate seat against the will of the political establishment. Charlie Crist, then the state&#x2019;s Republican governor, was the prime choice of party elders and national operatives. But Rubio rose from polling at just 3% to pull off an upset victory that made him an overnight star.&#xA;Rubio hopes to pull off another upset in 2016, an election that was once thought to belong to his former mentor Jeb Bush. Again, Rubio refused to wait his turn.&#xA;And although the establishment has yet to unite around Rubio&#x2019;s candidacy, he has ratcheted up key congressional endorsements and the support of high-dollar donors. Despite this, he is no moderate &#x2013; holding high marks from some of the largest conservative groups in the country.&#xA;But his prior support for comprehensive immigration reform remains a liability among the grassroots, and it is on this issue that he and Cruz are most at odds and have sparred in recent months.&#xA;They are also diametrically opposed on surveillance, with Rubio wishing to restore the NSA&#x2019;s dragnet intelligence gathering methods and Cruz having voted to end its bulk collection of phone records. And they hold a different view of what US foreign policy should resemble, with Rubio embracing more traditional neoconservatism and Cruz gravitating toward the non-interventionist leanings typically associated with libertarians.&#xA;Unlike Cruz, Rubio is well-liked among his colleages in the Senate &#x2013; which may be viewed with scepticism by Republican primary voters but could enable him to rally the party around his candidacy. His goal, he has said, is to unite the Republican party. To do so, he will have to persuade those leaning toward Cruz and Trump that anger alone is insufficient.&#xA;"/>

Myanmar remains riven by ethnic conflict involving, among others, the Shan, Karen, Kachin and Lisu peoples. Taken all together, minorities comprise about 40% of the population of 52 million, and most feel disadvantaged to some degree.&#xA;The outgoing president, Thein Sein, signed a national ceasefire agreement last October with eight leading armed groups. But fighting continues in many states, where local people seek greater autonomy and expanded rights over resources. Significant problems persist concerning political prisoners and minority activists held without trial.&#xA;Ending abuse of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, and the broader issue of how to curb Buddhist chauvinism, are other urgent issues. Most Rohingya were barred from voting and, for the first time since independence, they have no MP in parliament, the Burma Campaign UK pressure group said .&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;Ruling National League for Democracy chairwoman Aung San Suu Kyi arriving at the first session of the new parliament. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Imag&#xA;The NLD, led by national icon and Nobel peace prizewinner Aung San Suu Kyi, is not best placed to address this problem. It admitted before the election that Muslim candidates had been struck off its lists after pressure from nationalists.&#xA;Even with the national parliament in place, the unusually long transition to civilian rule is far from complete. An NLD-led government has yet to be installed. Most of the new MPs from whom the new administration must be drawn lack political experience. State and regional assemblies have yet to start work.&#xA;The new president will not take over until April. It will not be Aung San Suu Kyi , and her future role remains shrouded in uncertainty. Despite an 80% popular mandate measured in parliamentary votes, she is barred from the highest office due to an arbitrary constitutional prohibition engineered by the former junta.&#xA;Aung San Suu Kyi has said she will nevertheless be in charge , acting &#x201c;above the president&#x201d;, but it is unclear how this will work. She has so far given no indication as to who will take over from Thein Sein, and the NLD has no clear number two.&#xA;Constitutional gerrymandering by the Tatmadaw &#x2013; the military &#x2013; means it retains de facto control of key security ministries, including borders and defence. In a national crisis, as defined by the generals, the military has a legal right to take control of the government, including management of the economy.&#xA;The longer these uncertainties continue, the more drawn out the transition, and the more difficulty the NLD government faces in implementing new policies, the greater will be the impatience of voters for Aung San Suu Kyi to fulfil her mandate to bring real change.&#xA;Pinterest&#xA;A man working at a brick factory on the outskirts of Naypyidaw in Myanmar. Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP/Getty Images&#xA;As if this were not all difficult enough, Myanmar faces acute problems of poverty and child malnourishment, ramshackle education and healthcare systems, and a chronic lack of modern infrastructure. The legacy of social division and inter-communal distrust is formidable and will take years to overcome.&#xA;The NLD must also struggle with complicated strategic challenges. For years, China was the Tatmadaw&#x2019;s closest friend and ally. In return for turning a blind eye to political illegitimacy and human rights abuses, Beijing gained access to cheap natural resources and lucrative contracts, such as the now halted Myitsone dam project .&#xA;The US and EU, in contrast, championed the pro-democracy cause, maintaining sanctions on the junta. Even so, her overriding need to keep the army onside may lead Aung San Suu Kyi towards an accommodation with China , even if it means alienating the west.&#xA;While Aung San Suu Kyi has adopted positions that are generally receptive to China&#x2019;s interests, to the dismay of some supporters, the Chinese government has stirred up low-level trouble in some border areas in order to gain leverage and make the army appear indispensable, according to Min Zin, an analyst.&#xA;&#x201c;Several political and military officials in Myanmar and intelligence officers in Yunnan [said] they expect Beijing and the NLD to strike some kind of arrangement after the NLD forms a new government in a few months,&#x201d; Min Zin wrote .&#xA;&#x201c;China would press ethnic rebel groups to cooperate with the NLD on a national ceasefire accord, handing Aung San Suu Kyi a victory that has eluded the current government. In exchange, the NLD would yield to important Chinese interests in Myanmar, such as major infrastructure and investment projects.&#x201d;&#xA;Myanmar&#x2019;s so far limited democratic renaissance already has the full support of the west.

Rubio said he would not: &#x201c;I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.&#x201d;&#xA;On the trail, former Florida governor Jeb Bush interjected to say the free market would resolve climate change before government could.&#xA;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s someone in a garage somewhere,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;parochially I hope it&#x2019;s in Miami, that&#x2019;s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this.&#x201d;&#xA;Miami will settle for anyone doing something &#x2013; so long as it&#x2019;s before environmental changes driven by humans destroy the city&#x2019;s economy. Late last week, Mayor Tomás Regalado joined 14 other south Florida mayors in signing an open letter to Rubio, asking him to give up his opposition to climate change action.&#xA;Related: Republicans might as well deny climate change if they don't plan to address it | Suzanne Goldenberg&#xA;The low-lying city and its nearby resorts and islands suffer near annual floods from rising sea levels , costing the city hundreds of millions .

The idea is not only inhumane and a gross violation of basic European principles; it also would prove vastly more costly than the alternative &#x2013; a truly common EU policy that quells the chaos of the past year.&#xA;Six countries have already reimposed border controls, and the European commission is preparing to allow them, and presumably others, to do the same for two years.

It would be much less expensive, financially and politically, to establish a common EU border and coastguard, and a functioning EU asylum agency.&#xA;Related: Greeks worry threatened closure of EU border &#x2018;would be the definition of dystopia&#x2019;&#xA;This has proved to be, effectively, a zero-sum game. The rush by member states last year to seal their own perimeters left them unable to help shore up the EU&#x2019;s external borders. They failed to send Greece the personnel and ships it had been promised. As such, the need for national border controls has become a self-fulfilling prophecy.&#xA;A selfish, unilateral approach to borders constitutes a repeat of the tragedy of 2015, when EU member states individually spent about &#x20ac;40bn to address the crisis after it had reached European shores. In early 2015, the UN asked for a small fraction of that to feed, house and school the four million refugees in Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, but the international community and Europe failed to deliver (and many EU members still haven&#x2019;t paid their share). Unable to feed and educate their children, thousands of refugees ceded their savings to smugglers for a chance to reach Europe &#x2013; precisely what you and I would have done had we been in their place.&#xA;Europe cannot afford another such failure. The EU, working with the international community, must reassert humane control over the chaos around the Mediterranean. This entails immediate action on three fronts: first, raising the necessary tens of billions to allow refugees in frontline countries to live, work, and go to school there; states and the private sector must also help to create jobs both for refugees and natives through investments in the region and free-trade regimes.&#xA;Second, EU members must agree to accept several hundred thousand refugees directly from the region via safe, secure pathways and to match them to communities in Europe able to host them; failing to do this will alienate the frontline countries that bear most of the burden. Third, EU states must focus on creating a common-border regime, coastguard and asylum agency rather than return to the era of the Berlin Wall.&#xA;The EU is hurtling towards disintegration, not due to some insurmountable challenge or outside force. It is instead succumbing to a self-induced panic that has paralysed its common sense. It is time to end the nightmare.&#xA;Peter Sutherland is the UN special representative for migration&#xA;"/>

Will it pay off? | Lucia Graves&#xA;It was an attempt to resurrect the long-dead genre of vaudeville, only replacing acrobats with Rick Santorum and tenors with veterans.&#xA;In lieu of participating in the Fox News presidential debate, Trump held his own special salute to veterans in the Sheslow Auditorium at Des Moines&#x2019; Drake University. He served as ringmaster, prancing on and off stage as fellow presidential candidates, combat veterans and YouTube celebrities all took turns paying tribute both to Trump and those who have served in the US armed forces.&#xA;The crowd was a mix of Trump supporters, many of whom travelled in from all over the country, and local military veterans. For every hat representing an American Legion post that an attendee belonged to, or a naval ships on which they served, there was a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The crowd was leavened by a healthy mix of members of the national media, television anchors, cameramen and those writers fortunate enough not to be booted to a spare media filing room off-stage.&#xA;The event came about days after Trump announced he would boycott the presidential debate. He said he made the decision after the network sent out a press release that Trump believed was derogatory.&#xA;The Republican frontrunner had long refused to commit to participating in the debate, because of his ongoing feud with Fox anchor Megyn Kelly , with whom he sparred in the first presidential debate last August. The release was the final straw for Trump.&#xA;&#x201c;I probably won&#x2019;t bother to do the debate,&#x201d; Trump said in a press conference held in a high school gym in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Tuesday. &#x201c;I am going to have something else in Iowa , something simultaneously with the debate.&#x201d; Trump said this event would raise money for &#x201c;veterans and the wounded warriors&#x201d;.&#xA;Trump waited all of 15 minutes after the scheduled start of the Republican debate at 8pm local time to take center stage. Addressing the crowd, Trump, with typical bravado, insisted that Fox had been desperate to get him back in the debate.&#xA;&#x201c;Fox has been extremely nice the last number of hours and they wanted me there,&#x201d; said Trump. However, the GOP frontrunner said he couldn&#x2019;t show up because he was hosting Thursday&#x2019;s event for veterans. This account was disputed in a press release from Fox News.&#xA;Related: Trump sidelined as Republican rivals debate without frontrunner&#xA;As Trump described it, &#x201c;once this ball started rolling we couldn&#x2019;t stop it.&#x201d; He then spent several minutes listing various real estate developers who had made large donations to his effort to raise money for veterans.&#xA;Afterdoling out his obligatory insults aimed at &#x201c;low energy&#x201d; Jeb Bush, Trump introduced two other Republican candidates, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, fresh from the undercard Republican debate across town.&#xA;Huckabee and Santorum, two past winners of the Iowa caucuses, both talked briefly about their deep concern for veterans while dealing with the awkwardness of speaking behind a podium with &#x201c;TRUMP&#x201d; emblazoned on it.&#xA;&#x201c;I am supporting another candidate for president,&#x201d; Santorum joked, while Huckabee just embraced the awkwardness: &#x201c;I figure you&#x2019;re going to get the photo anyway.&#x201d;&#xA;Following the appearance of his two opponents in the race for the Republican nomination, Trump introduced veteran and activist John Wayne Walding, who lost his leg in combat.&#xA;&#x201c;He should be more famous than me because he&#x2019;s a lot more courageous than me,&#x201d; Trump said, introducing his special guest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m financially courageous, about the other stuff I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;&#xA;"/>

It appeared in Africa, south-east Asia and the Pacific islands prior to 2015, but without reports of microcephaly too. Experts are now urgently investigating to see if incidents were missed.&#xA;If zika is implicated in South America it is possible that it is not the sole cause. Further investigations will look at whether women whose babies were born with defects had been infected by dengue or chikungunya as well, in case a combination of viruses is to blame. They will also want to find out how many babies of women with zika virus have been born without the birth defect.&#xA;When Ebola spread across west Africa and the WHO for too long failed to call an international health emergency, there was no doubt the virus was killing people in a terrible way and that the infection was being passed from one person to another. Zika is a massive worry, but investigations and warnings to women who are or might become pregnant are likely to be the main response for now.&#xA;Related: Zika isn&#x2019;t a global health threat like Ebola. It needs a targeted response | Clare Wenham&#xA;Chan is calling the meeting for Monday in part because she is afraid that people and businesses will boycott Brazil and other affected countries. That was one of the reasons for delaying the declaration of an emergency in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, all of which were badly hit when airlines stopped flying and businesses shut up shop.&#xA;So for now, a declaration of international health emergency in South America is unlikely. But the answers to a lot of questions need to be found fast.&#xA;"/>

The financial cost of the war is causing alarm in Riyadh, where a sharp decline in oil revenues has led to a ballooning budget deficit and unprecedented subsidy cuts. But the escalation of tensions with Iran is likely to make diplomacy harder.&#xA;Saudi analyst Mohammed Alyahya said the UN report &#x201c;was prepared far away from Yemen and used satellite imagery to document allegations of human rights violations. It is not an investigation. The report itself is calling on the United Nations to investigate these allegations.&#xA;&#x201c;The Yemeni government&#x2019;s investigations into human rights violations is currently underway. No report can be taken seriously if its authors weren&#x2019;t even in Yemen to conduct investigations.&#x201d; The UN team was not given permission to enter the country.&#xA;The key moment on the path to Saudi intervention came in September 2014, after a UN-sponsored political dialogue broke down and Houthi fighters took over Sana&#x2019;a, forcing Mansour Hadi to flee, first to Aden and then to Riyadh.&#xA;The Saudis say their priority is to have a stable neighbour to the south and to protect their southern cities. Last September, the UN human rights council dropped plans for an international inquiry into human rights violations by all parties in the war in Yemen .&#xA;"/>

But they are no joke | Jonathan Freedland&#xA;I find the ad mesmerising, for all the wrong reasons. In it Trump is transformed into a weirdly plausible figure. Imagine all that bombast, tough talk and misplaced certainty expended in the service of causes including universal healthcare, immigrants&#x2019; rights and gun control. If you close your eyes, he sounds a bit like Bernie Sanders .&#xA;Whenever Trump&#x2019;s supporters claim their candidate tells it like it is, they actually mean he tells them what they want to hear. But I was not prepared for how it would feel if he told me what I wanted to hear. Re-imagined as a liberal, Trump suddenly acquires a certain reptilian charm.&#xA;Like all attack ads, however, this one is completely misleading: the only political stance Trump has ever held with any consistency is the pro-Trump stance; If it&#x2019;s good for him, he will embrace it, however hypocritically or temporarily. what he actually believes isn&#x2019;t really an issue.&#xA;The ad was made by a super PAC founded by Mitt Romney&#x2019;s former deputy campaign manager, and Trump&#x2019;s exhumed views are meant to make him sound not just untrustworthy, but dangerously leftwing. In what has already been the weirdest primary campaign ever, it stands to reason that a two-and-a-half-minute montage of every sensible thing Trump ever said could finally prove his undoing.&#xA;Cut from the same cloth&#xA;When I interviewed him recently, the comedian Robin Ince mentioned that he owns seven identical cardigans to spare him the need to make wardrobe choices, citing Einstein as his inspiration. Facebook&#x2019;s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, recently posted a snap of his wardrobe, containing nine identical grey T-shirts and seven matching hoodies , a system he says he instituted &#x201c;so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything&#x201d; .&#xA;As someone who works from home, I regard Ince and Zuckerberg as men insufficiently committed to the notion of sameness. When I say I wear the same cardigan every day to avoid decision-making, I don&#x2019;t mean one of several identical versions of that cardigan: I mean the exact same cardigan. Every day. What happens, people will ask, when it gets so grubby that you finally need to wash it? My answer is: I&#x2019;ll cross that bridge when I come to it.&#xA;Grey squirrels&#x2019; trump card&#xA;As a fellow American invader of these isles, I&#x2019;ve always sympathised with the grey squirrel. Britons seem to take their adaptation to the UK personally, as if they thrive just to piss everyone off. No one ever feels let down by the red squirrels.&#xA;Now it turns out that greys did not flourish because of their competitive spirit or knack for harbouring disease. They had help. According to two new scientific papers , grey squirrels didn&#x2019;t just breed their way across the British Isles, they were actively distributed, in particular by the 11th Duke of Bedford, who sent them all round the country as gifts around the turn of the last century. Were it not for repeated human-mediated &#x201c;translocation&#x201d;, grey squirrels wouldn&#x2019;t have displaced reds so comprehensively. But it&#x2019;s easier to blame the immigrants. Ask Trump.&#xA;"/>
